<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>
Quilvyn is a browser-based editor for RPG characters, particularly those
generated using rules derived from the System Reference Document from Wizards
of the Coast. It allows you to enter and modify basic information about a
character&#151;race, class levels, attributes like strength, and so on&#151;and
applies the rules from SRD v3.5 and other rule sets to modify these basic
attributes and calculate computed attributes like saving throw bonuses and
armor class. The program formats character attributes into a compact
(typically one page) character sheet web page that you can print for reference
during game play. You can save character information and later reload it into
Quilvyn to update the character's attributes.
</p>

<a name="install"><h3>Installing and Running Quilvyn</h3></a>
<p>
A tar and/or zip file containing the Quilvyn code can be obtained from
<a href='https://github.com/jodaf/quilvyn-core/releases'>https://github.com/jodaf/quilvyn-core/releases</a>.
The Quilvyn program consists of 14 files: README.md, index.html, quilvyn.html,
core/Expr.js, core/Input.js, core/ObjectViewer.js, core/Quilvyn.js,
core/QuilvynRules.js, core/QuilvynUtils.js, core/RuleEngine.js, core/gpl.txt,
core/quilvyn.gif, plugins/SRD35.js, and plugins/ogl.txt. Documentation is
provided by core/quilvyndoc.html and a pair of image files,
core/editingobjects.gif and core/sheetfeatures.gif. In addition, the download
also contains plugins/SRD35SpellPoints.js, which defines an alternative way of
managing spellcasting. Using this is optional.
</p><p>
Quilvyn has been successfully tested using these browsers
<ul>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Google Chrome</li>
  <li>Opera</li>
  <li>Edge</li>
  <li>Safari (remote installation only&#151;Safari prohibits local pop-up windows)</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
quilvyn.html contains a section of definitions that allow you to set some user
preferences. Quilvyn uses the BACKGROUND setting as the background color for
its windows, and the program uses the DEFAULT_SHEET_STYLE to determine which
style to use for character sheets. WARN_ABOUT_DISCARD determines whether or not
Quilvyn warns you when ask to open a new character after making changes to the
current one without saving. You can also add character sheet and editor
customizations in quilvyn.html. See the comments in that file for details.
</p><p>
To run Quilvyn, simply use one of the web browsers listed above to open your
local copy of quilvyn.html. If the program opens a plugin selection window,
check the plugins you wish to use and press the "Ok" button to start the
character editor. Quilvyn is written in JavaScript and makes extensive use of
pop-up windows, so you must have both of these enabled in your browser. A
reference installation of Quilvyn using the latest sources is available at
<a href="http://www.jodaf.com/dnd/q2/">http://www.jodaf.com/dnd/q2/</a>.
</p>

<a name="open"><h3>Generating and Loading Characters</h3></a>
<p>
Generating new characters and loading previously saved ones are both handled
through Quilvyn's Character menu. The choices in this menu allow you to
generate a new character, generate a character with random attribute values,
reload the information for a previously-saved character, or import a character
from information saved from a different browser. When you ask for a random
character, Quilvyn opens a form that allows you to specify certain attributes,
such as race and class level(s). This helps in the generation of NPCs. You can
either specify these attributes, or leave the form unchanged to have Quilvyn
choose them randomly.
</p><p>
The Character menu's Import option allows you to transfer character information
saved from another browser. In the Import pop-up window, paste the character
attributes definition ("var attributes = { ... }") from the header of the
saved character sheet, then press OK. Quilvyn displays the character sheet
generated from these attributes and saves the character into your browser's
persistent storage. If you paste the attributes of multiple characters into a
single Import pop-up, Quilvyn saves all of them and displays the last.
</p>

<a name="edit"><h3>Editing Characters</h3></a>
<p>
<img src='editingobjects.gif' alt='Editing widgets' align='left'/>
The Quilvyn editor contains editing objects that allow you to change basic
character attributes. The editor uses three different types of editing objects.
<i>Text fields</i> are used for attributes, such as name and player, that have
an infinite number of possible values. To modify one of these attributes,
simply type the new value into the text field. In text fields that contain a
number (e.g., hit points) you can instead enter a '+' followed by a number, and
Quilvyn will add the number to the existing value of the field. <i>Selection
menus</i> are used with attributes like alignment, race, and abilities like
strength and intelligence. These editing objects give you a pull-down menu that
contains all the possible values. Simply select the correct one to change the
attribute. <i>Set menus</i> are used for collections of related attributes like
skills, feats, weapons, and class levels. Along with a pull-down menu, these
editing objects include either a checkbox or a small text field where you can
enter a value. A checkbox is used for attributes, such as spells, where the
character either has an attribute or not; the text field is used with
attributes (e.g., skills, class levels) where the character has a variable
score associated with the attribute. To change one of these attributes, first
use the pull-down menu to select a particular attribute, then click the
checkbox or enter a value in the text field. A "Clear All" button next to set
menus lets you clear all attributes in a set with a single click. Some set
menus have an accompanying filter box that allows you to determine which
choices appear in its menu. This menu allows you to limit the choices shown to
those of interest; only those choices that contain the text in this box are
displayed in the menu.
</p><p>
In a separate browser frame or window, Quilvyn displays a character sheet based
on the values of the editor. Every time you change a value in the editor,
Quilvyn applies the rules from the selected rule set, then updates the
character sheet to show you any computed changes.
</p><p>
Three "Show" checkboxes provide some control over what attributes the character
sheet displays. The "Italic Notes" checkbox determines whether or not
italicized notes are included on the sheet. See <a href='#sheet'>the
discussion of the character sheet</a> for an explanation as to why some notes
are italicized and others are not. Checking the "Extras" box adds to the
character sheet attributes such as race and class features that can be useful
for reference during character development but that are not often used during
play. The "Hidden" box allows you to produce a character sheet that contains
additional information that should not be seen by the player. This includes any
notes entered in the editor's "Hidden Notes" box and any attributes that depend
on the "hidden" attribute.
</p><p>
A few items in the editor window don't relate directly to the contents of the
character sheet. The "About" button opens a window with text describing
Quilvyn, and the "Help" button opens one that contains this document. The
"Rules" pull-down allows you to change between different character-generation
rule sets&#151;Quilvyn comes with support for the v3.5 System Reference
Document, and plug-ins for different game versions and particular campaign
settings are available. The "Notes" and "Rules" buttons next to this pull-down
open windows with details about the particular rule set, and the Custom Items
pull-down is discussed in <a href="#custom">Adding Custom Items</a>. The
"Character" menu is discussed in
<a href='#open'>Generating and Loading Characters</a>. The "Summary" item in
the character menu opens a window with a table that summarizes attributes from
all characters that you've opened since starting Quilvyn. This is intended to
assist in planning and running adventures by providing a compact summary of the
abilities of all the characters in a party. The "Save", "Save As...",
"Delete...", and "HTML" items in the character menu are described in
<a href='#save'>Saving Characters</a>. The "Sheet Style" pull-down allows you
to choose between different character sheet formats.
</p>

<a name="random"><h3>Randomizing Attributes</h3></a>
<p>
The "Randomize" menu allows you to let Quilvyn randomly determine most basic
Quilvyn character attributes. The editor will select a random value for the
attribute you choose and update both the editor display and the character
sheet. For the six basic attributes&#151;strength, intelligence, wisdom,
constitution, dexterity, and charisma&#151;Quilvyn computes the random value by
randomly generating four numbers from 1 to 6 and summing the highest three.
For other selection attributes, Quilvyn randomly selects one of the possible
values. When selecting set values such as spells and feats, Quilvyn uses other
information about the character (e.g., feat count) to randomly select the
attribute values. Quilvyn selects enough set values to fill in the number of
values appropriate for the character. For example, if a character is entitled
to seven feats and five are already assigned, Quilvyn will randomly select the
remaining two. The only text attribute that Quilvyn knows how to randomize is
the character name. The names that the editor generates are more often amusing
than useful, but you can usually get a pretty decent name from them with a
little creative editing.
</p>

<a name="save"><h3>Saving Characters</h3></a>
<p>
For security reasons, programs like Quilvyn are prohibited from writing files
to your hard disk. Instead, character information is saved to your browser's
persistent storage, where Quilvyn can access it later. The "Save" and
"Save As..." items from the Character menu write information about the current
character to the browser's persistent storage. You can later retrieve a saved
character by selecting the character path from the Character menu. Use the
"Delete..." item from the Character menu to remove a character's information
from persistent storage.
</p><p>
If you want to cache a copy of your character sheet for viewing outside of
Quilvyn, select the "HTML" item in the Character menu. Quilvyn opens a new
window that contains the HTML for the character sheet. Copy and paste the
contents of this window into your favorite editor and save the result as a web
page (a file with an extension of .html or .htm).
</p><p>
Selecting the "Export..." item from the character menu opens a new window that
displays the attributes for all characters in your browser's persistent
storage. You can copy the contents of this window to a file for backup, or you
can paste them into a Quilvyn Import window in a different browser to transfer
characters from one browser to another.
</p>

<a name="sheet"><h3>The Character Sheet</h3></a>
<p>
<img src='sheetfeatures.gif' alt='Character sheet features' align='center'/>
</p><p>
The standard character sheet format that Quilvyn produces contains up to six
sections: Header; Basic Attributes; Features and Skills; Combat; Magic; and
Notes. Each of these lists related character attribute values, both entered
and computed, along with notes about the attributes. Although most of the
information on the sheet should be clear, a few aspects of the format require
explanation.
<ul>
  <li>
    In the Basic Attributes section, the computed modifier values for strength,
    wisdom, etc. are shown in parentheses after the attribute value.
  </li><li>
    In the skills section, the sheet shows the number of ranks allocated to
    each skill. Each skill modifier appears in parentheses after the skill
    rank value.
  </li><li>
    Some attribute notes appear in italics; others in plain text. The
    italicized notes describe the effects of rules that Quilvyn used in
    computing attributes. For example, a sheet for a halfling character might
    include an italicized note reading "<i>Halfling Ability Adjustment: +2
    dexterity/-2 strength</i>", indicating that Quilvyn has added two to
    dexterity value shown on the character sheet and subtracted two from the
    strength value. Italicized notes can normally be ignored during play, since
    Quilvyn has already incorporated the effect on the character sheet. Plain
    text notes, on the other hand, describe rule effects that need to be
    applied during the game, so these should be examined closely. For example,
    the Combat section of a halfling's character sheet might include the plain
    text note "Accurate: +1 attack with slings/thrown". When rolling a sling
    attack throw for this character, you'll need to add one to the rolled value.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="validation"><h3>Character Validation</h3></a>
<p>
Many feats have prerequisites that the character must meet before selecting
that feat. A few base classes have alignment restrictions, and all prestige
classes have prerequisites. Quilvyn doesn't enforce these requirements; you're
free to enter, say, a chaotic neutral monk if you want to. However, in the
notes section of the character sheet, the program includes validation notes
about any restrictions that the character violates. These informational notes
make you aware of any unmet restrictions, giving you the information you need
to correct mistakes in the character attributes. An additional list shows
Sanity Notes&#151;comments on character attributes that, while legal, make
little sense. For example, Quilvyn will warn you about a character whose Track
feat is made useless by the absence of any ranks in the Survival skill.
</p>

<a name="goodies"><h3>Magic Items and Special Possessions</h3></a>
<p>
You can list character possessions in the Notes section of the character sheet.
Quilvyn assumes that any lines in this section that begin with an asterisk mark
items that affect character attributes&#151;abilities, armor class, etc.
Quilvyn refers to items with such effects as "goodies". To have Quilvyn perform
calculations using one of these items, include the name of the affected
attribute and the amount of bonus with it. For example, including these three
lines in the Notes section will raise the character's strength by two, their
Sleight Of Hand skill by four, and their attack and damage with longswords by 1:
</p><p>
* Ring of Strength +2<br/>
* Cloak of Distraction (Sleight Of Hand skill +4)<br/>
* +1 Longsword
</p><p>
Multiple items can be listed on a single line separated by semicolons, so the
above three items can also be listed as:
</p><p>
* Ring of Strength +2; Cloak of Shielding (Sleight Of Hand skill +4); +1 Longsword
</p><p>
Along with bonuses (and negative values for harmful items), Quilvyn computes the
modifiers for armor and weapons listed as having masterwork quality. You can
also note effects that change a normally cross-class skill into a class skill.
</p><p>
* Masterwork longsword<br/>
* Nomad background: Ride is a class skill<br/>
</p>

<a name="custom"><h3>Adding Custom Items</h3></a>
<p>
You can add weapons, armor, familiars, and other items to Quilvyn's menus using
the Custom Items pull-down menu. Custom items are grouped into named
<i>collections</i> that you can apply to a rule set to make the items
available. The Custom Items pull-down displays the name of the current
collection. In addition to user-defined collections, Quilvyn predefines a
custom item collection for each loaded rule set. Every time Quilvyn runs, it
automatically adds items in each predefined collection to the corresponding
rule set; there's no need to apply the collection to its rule as a separate
step.
</p><p>
Selecting the "New Collection..." item in the Custom Items menu creates a new
collection with the name of your choice and makes it the current collection.
</p><p>
Selecting the "Delete Collection..." item in the Custom Items menu allows you
to remove a user-defined collection and all the items in it. Deleting one of
Quilvyn's predefined collections removes any items it contains but does not
delete the collection itself.
</p><p>
The "View/Export All" and "Import..." items in the Custom Items menu allow you
to save and later reload your custom items. This can be useful for backup
purposes and for copying custom items when you change browsers.
</p><p>
Selecting the "Add Items..." item in the Custom Items menu opens a dialog box
where you can enter the attributes for new custom items. Begin by using the
"Type" menu to select the type of item you want to add. Quilvyn displays a set
of editing objects that allow you to enter attributes specific to that type of
item. For example, if you select "Weapon", editing objects will appear that
allow you to enter the new weapon's name, group (Simple, Martial, or Exotic),
category (Unarmed, Light, One-Handed, Two-Handed, or Ranged), damage, critical
threat threshold, critical damage multiplier, and (for ranged weapons) range
increment. Once you have entered all the necessary information, press the "Add"
button. Your new item is saved in the current collection.
</p><p>
The "Delete Item..." item in the Custom Items menu opens a dialog box that
allows you to remove a previously-entered custom item from the current
collection. Note that, once a collection has been applied to the current rule
set, deleted items continue to appear in the editor menu until the next time
you launch Quilvyn.
</p><p>
Selecting the "Apply Collection..." item in the Custom Items menu allows you to
add the custom items defined in the current collection to the current rule set.
As mentioned above, Quilvyn automatically adds items in its predefined
collections to the corresponding rule sets. The "Apply Collection..." item
provides a way to make items from user-defined collections available in the
editor menus.
</p><p>
For most custom item attributes, the values to enter into the Add Item dialog
can be determined by looking at similar items from the core rule books. For
example, for a new Animal Companion, Quilvyn prompts for the six basic
abilities, hit dice, armor class, and damage, all of which are integer values.
For Animal Companion damage, Quilvyn expects text in the format
int'd'int[+int][,int'd'int[+int]]. For an Ape, the value would be 1d6+5,1d6+2;
for a Baboon, 1d6+3. Text values that contain spaces need to be surrounded by
double quotes, and multiple values entered in a single box should be separated
by commas. For example, when entering a new Deity, you might enter "Light Mace"
as in the Favored Weapon box and Good,Law,Strength in the Domain box.
</p><p>
In Quilvyn, Features describe the effects of both feats and class and racial
features such as Darkvision and Bardic Knowledge. When adding a new feature,
select the section of the character sheet where the note for the feature should
appear, then enter the note text. Much like the starred notes discussed
<a href="#goodies">above</a>, Quilvyn interprets the text of this note to
update affected attributes. For example, if you add a feature named "Glib" with
a note in the skill section that reads "+2 Bluff/+2 Perform (Oratory)", Quilvyn
will update the skill modifier values for any character with that feature.
</p><p>
Many feats and classes have prerequisites that a character must meet in order
to select them. In the customization dialog, these can be entered in the
Prerequisite box for a new feat or class, with multiple prerequisites separated
by commas. For example, taking a level in the Horizon Walker prestige class
requires that the character have the Endurance feature and 8 ranks in Knowledge
(Geography). This would be entered into the Prerequisite box for a custom
class as follows. (Remember that text containing a space needs to be enclosed
in double quotes.)
<pre>
  features.Endurance,"skills.Knowledge (Geography) >= 8"
</pre>
The Feat entry includes a similar Implies box for testing whether selecting
the feat makes sense for a character. For example, although legal, selecting
the Track feat makes no sense for a character with no ranks in Survival, so the
Implies box for this feat would read
<pre>
  "skills.Survival > 0"
</pre>
</p>
