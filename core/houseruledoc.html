<h2>Adding House Rules to Quilvyn's SRD v3.5 Rule Set</h2>

<p>
The SRD35 rule set allows you to add custom items to most of its selections:
companions, weapons, races, and so on. The entry dialog for each type of item
includes fields for all the information particular to that item type. For most
customizations, the values to enter into the dialog can be determined by
looking at similar items from the core rule books.
</p>
On occasions when you need to enter multiple values into a single text box
(e.g., the list of domains for a custom deity), separate the values with
commas. If you need to enter a value that contains a comma into a text box,
put quotes before and after the value.

<a name="animal-companion"><h3>Adding Animal Companions and Familiars</h3></a>
<img src='../Images/hr-familiar.jpg' alt='House Rule Familiar'/>
</td><td>
<p>
Identical information is required for adding an animal companion or familiar.
Along with the creature's basic attributes, Quilvyn displays fields for
entering Hit Dice, Armor Class, Attack Bonus, Damage, Size, and Min Master
Level. Quilvyn expects the Damage value to indicate the number and type of
damage dice, optionally followed by a bonus or penalty. For example, an Owlbear
animal companion would have a Damage attribute of 1d6+5,1d6+5,1d8+2 (two claws
and a bite); while a Baboon's Damage would be 1d6+3. When entering Armor Class,
Attack Bonus, and Damage, include any bonus or penalty from elements such as
dexterity, natural armor, and strength. Min Master Level is used for
alternative companions that require the character to be of higher level before
they can be selected.
</p><p>
The example shown is taken from the statistics for the monkey in the Monster
Manual. Note that the monkey receives +2 size and +2 dexterity bonuses to Armor
Class, resulting in an overall AC of 14, and that the monkey's low strength
gives a -4 penalty to damage.

<a name="armor"><h3>Adding Armors</h3></a>
<img src='../Images/hr-armor.jpg' alt='House Rule Armor'/>
</td><td>
<p>
Identical information is required for adding a custom type of armor or shield.
Quilvyn displays fields for the boost in AC gained by using the armor or
shield, the item's weight category, the maximum dexterity AC bonus allowed when
using the item, the penalty applied to skills such as Escape Artist, and the
percentage chance of failure when casting arcane spells while using the item.
</p><p>
The example shown gives the values for a breastplate made from mithril, as
discussed in the Special Materials section of the SRD. Mithril items reduce
the item's weight by 1 category, spell failure chances by 10%, and armor check
penalty by 3 while increasing the maximum dexterity bonus by 2.

</td><td>
<p>
When adding a custom deity, Quilvyn displays fields to add the deity's
alignment, favored weapon or weapons, and domains. Multiple domains entered
in the Domains text box should be separated by commas. Similarly, if the
deity's favored weapon includes multiple weapons (e.g., all flails),
the individual weapons should be listed in the Favored Weapons text box,
separated by commas.

<a name="feat"><h3>Adding Feats</h3></a>
<img src='../Images/hr-feat.jpg' alt='House Rule Feat'/>
</td><td>
<p>
When adding a custom feat, Quilvyn displays fields to note the feat type(s) and
any requirements that should be met to select it. The feat type will typically
be one of General, Item Creation, or Metamagic; you can also include Fighter in
the feat type box to indicate that this feat can be selected as a fighter bonus
feat. Quilvyn allows you to specify two kinds of requirements for a feat. The
Prerequisite box lists any requirements that must be met to select the feat;
Quilvyn generates a validation error if the feat is selected for a character
who does not meet these requirements. The Implies box lists any requirements
that, while not strictly required, make the feat useless if not met. For
example, although the rules don't require a caster level to select it, the
Combat Casting feat from the core rules is likely to be useful only to a spell
caster. Quilvyn will generate a validation warning if the Implies requirements
are not met. The effects of a feat are entered separately as a feature,
<a href="#feature">described below</a>.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a general feat named Flail Expert that can be
selected as a fighter bonus feat. The Prerequisite box note that it requires a
baseAttack value of at least 1 and Weapon Proficiency (Martial), and the
Implies box notes that the feat is useless unless the character has a flail.

<a name="feature"><h3>Adding Features</h3></a>
<img src='../Images/hr-feature.jpg' alt='House Rule Feature'/>
</td><td>
<p>
In Quilvyn, Features describe the effects of feats, classes, and racial
features. When adding a rule for a new Feature, select the section of the
character sheet where the note for the Feature should appear, then enter the
note text. Much like the starred notes discussed <a href="#goodies">above</a>,
Quilvyn interprets the text of this note to update affected attributes. In the
example shown, Quilvyn will add 2 to the Bluff and Perform (Oratory) skill
modifier values for any character with that feature.

<p>
Adding a new language requires only specifying the name. Once added, languages
can be added to a character by selecting from the language list and can be
included in the list of languages automatically known by custom races.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a language called Scaletongue, used
<a href="#race">below</a> in the example for entering a custom race.

<p>
When adding a custom skill, Quilvyn displays fields that allow you to enter
the skill's key ability, whether the skill can be used untrained, the list of
classes for which the class skill, and any synergies that the custom skill has
with other skills.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for the Sailing skill, which is related to
intelligence, requires training to use, and is a class skill for several core
classes.

<a name="spell"><h3>Adding Spells</h3></a>

<p>
When adding a custom spell, Quilvyn displays fields that allow you to enter
the spell's school, the list of classes and levels for the spell, the
description of the spell, and whether or not the spell can be placed into a
potion that can be drunk or an oil that can be applied. Spell descriptions can
contain references to character attributes; see the discussion
<a href=#expr>below</a> for how to include these.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for the transmutation spell <i>Enhance Skill</i>,
which is a level 3 spell for clerics, sorcerers, and druids. It can be invoked
using an imbibed potion, and the description notes that spell can be cast over
short range and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the caster level.

<a name="weapon"><h3>Adding Weapons</h3></a>
<img src='../Images/hr-weapon.jpg' alt='House Rule Weapon'/>
</td><td>
<p>
When adding a custom weapon, Quilvyn displays fields that allow you to enter
the weapon's group (Simple, Martial, or Exotic), category (Unarmed, Light,
One-Handed, Two-Handed, or Ranged), damage, critical threat range and
multiplier, and (for ranged weapons) range increment.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a boomerang, an exotic ranged weapon with a
40' range increment that inflicts d4 damage, with critical threat and damage
of 19-20/x2.
