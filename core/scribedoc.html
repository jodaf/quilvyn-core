<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>
Scribe is a web-based editor for AD&amp;D characters.  It allows you to enter
and modify basic information about a character&#151;race, class levels,
attributes like strength, and so on&#151;and applies the rules from the third
edition Player's Handbook to modify these basic attributes and calculate
generated attributes like saving throw bonuses and armor class.  The program
formats character attributes into a compact (typically one page) character
sheet web page that you can print for reference during game play.  You can save
this web page in a file and later reload it into Scribe to update the
character's attributes.  Customization features allow you to incorporate house
rules into both the editor and character sheet.
</p>

<a name="install"><h3>Installing and Running Scribe</h3></a>
<p>
A tar file containing the Scribe code can be obtained from
<a href='http://www.jodaf.com/software/scribe/scribe.tar'>www.jodaf.com/software/scribe/scribe.tar</a>.
The Scribe program consists of 12 files: Input.js, ObjectViewer.js,
PH35.js, RuleEngine.js, Scribe.js, ScribeRules.js, ScribeUtils.js, gpl.txt,
scribe.gif, scribe.html, scribeattrs.html, and scribedoc.html.  In addition,
the download contains DMG35.js, which defines the prestige and non-player
classes from the Dungeon Masters guide, MN2E.js and MN2EPrestige.js, which
define the rules for the Midnight role playing game, and several customization
files.  Using any of these is optional.  It is possible to install only
scribe.html and direct Scribe to download the other files when the program
runs.  Doing so ensures that you get the latest version of Scribe every time
you run the program; however, it also means that you have to wait for the
download each time. See scribe.html for details.
</p><p>
Scribe has been successfully tested using these browsers
<ul>
  <li>Linux Galeon v1.2 and v1.3</li>
  <li>Linux Mozilla v1.0 and v1.7</li>
  <li>Macintosh OS X Firefox v1.0 and v2.0</li>
  <li>Macintosh OS X Internet Explorer v5.2</li>
  <li>Macintosh OS X Safari v1.2</li>
  <li>Windows Firefox v2.0</li>
  <li>Windows Internet Explorer v6.0</li>
  <li>Windows Opera v7.54</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
scribe.html contains a section of definitions that allow you to set some user
preferences.  Scribe uses the BACKGROUND setting as the background color for
its windows, and the program uses the URL_PREFIX and URL_SUFFIX values to
expand abbreviated values entered in the open dialogue.  For example, if
URL_PREFIX is "file:///home/farquar/Scribe/characters/" and URL_SUFFIX is
".html", than you can simply enter "jorash" into the open dialogue to open the
character file "file:///home/farquar/Scribe/characters/jorash.html".  The value
of MAX_RECENT_OPENS determines how many recently-opened character URLs appear
in the New/Open menu, and WARN_ABOUT_DISCARD determines whether or not Scribe
warns you when ask to open a new character after making changes to the current
one without saving. You can also add character sheet and editor customizations
in scribe.html.  See the <a href="#custom">customization section</a> for
details.
</p><p>
To run Scribe, simply use one of the web browsers listed above to open
scribe.html.
</p>

<a name="open"><h3>Generating and Loading Characters</h3></a>
<p>
Generating new characters and loading previously saved ones are both handled
through Scribe's New/Open menu.  The choices in this menu allow you to generate
a new character with random attribute values, enter the URL of an existing
character file, or reopen the file of a recently-opened character. The URL for
character files will usually begin with "file://", followed by the path to the
file where you previously saved the character (see <a href="#save">Saving
Characters</a> below).  When you ask for a new, randomized character, Scribe
opens a form that allows you to specify the character's race and/or class
level(s).  This helps DMs to use Scribe to generate NPCs.  You can either
specify these attributes, or leave the form blank to have Scribe generate them
randomly.
</p>

<a name="edit"><h3>Editing Characters</h3></a>
<p>
The Scribe editing window contains editing objects that allow you to change
basic character attributes.  The editor uses three different types of editing
objects.  <i>Text fields</i> are used for attributes, such as name and player,
that have an infinite number of possible values.  To modify one of these
attributes, simply type the new value into the text field.  In text fields
that contain a number (e.g., experience points) you can instead enter a '+'
followed by a number, and Scribe will add the number to the existing value of
the field.  <i>Selection menus</i> are used with attributes like alignment,
race, and abilities like strength and intelligence.  These editing objects give
you a pull-down menu that contains all the possible values.  Simply select the
correct one to change the attribute. <i>Set menus</i> are used for collections
of related attributes like skills, feats, weapons, and class levels.  Along
with a pull-down menu, these editing objects include either a checkbox or a
small text field where you can enter a value.  A checkbox is used for
attributes, such as spells, where the character either has an attribute or not;
the text field is used with attributes (e.g., skills, class levels) where the
character has a variable score associated with the attribute.  To change one of
these attributes, first use the pull-down menu to select a particular
attribute, then click the checkbox or enter a value in the text field.  A
"Clear" button next to set menus lets you clear all attributes in a set with a
single click.
</p><p>
In your main browser window, Scribe displays a character sheet based on the
values of the editing window.  Every time you change a value in the editing
window, Scribe applies the rules from the AD&amp;D v3.5 Player's Handbook, then
updates the character sheet to show you any computed changes.
</p><p>
The three "Show" checkboxes provide some control over what attributes the
character sheet displays.  The "Italic Notes" checkbox determines whether or
not italicized notes are included on the sheet.  See <a href='#sheet'>the
discussion of the character sheet</a> for an explanation as to why some notes
are italicized and others are not.  The "Untrained Skills" checkbox determines
whether Scribe includes in the character's skill list those skills that may be
used even when no skill points have been allocated to them.  The "DM Info" box
determines whether or not the character sheet includes any information marked
for the Dungeon Master only.  This includes any notes entered in the editor's
"DM Notes" box and any attributes that depend on the "dmonly" attribute.
</p><p>
A few items in the editor window don't relate directly to the character sheet.
The "New/Open" button is discussed in in <a href='#open'>Generating and
Loading Characters</a> and the "View HTML" button in <a href='#save'>Saving
Characters</a>.  The "Help" button opens a window that contains this
document, and the "About" button opens one with text describing Scribe.  The
"Validate" button checks the current character values against restrictions from
the Player's Handbook.  Scribe allows you to enter a character that doesn't
meet these restrictions (e.g., a chaotic monk), but will warn you when you
press this button.  The "Summary" button opens a window with a table that
summarizes attributes from all characters that you've opened since starting
Scribe.  This is intended to assist DMs in planning and running campaigns by
providing a compact summary of the abilities of all the characters in a party.
Finally, the "Spell Filter" text box allows you to determine which spells
appear in the "Spells" set menu.  Since hundreds of spells and variations are
available, this menu allows you to limit the spells (e.g. cleric spells, air
domain spells) of interest.  Only those spells that match the text in this box
are included in the spells set menu.
</p>

<a name="random"><h3>Randomizing Attributes</h3></a>
<p>
The "Randomize" menu allows you to let Scribe randomly determine most basic
Scribe character attributes.  The editor will select a random value for the
attribute you choose and update both the editing display and the character
sheet.  For the six basic attributes&#151;strength, intelligence, wisdom,
constitution, dexterity, and charisma&#151;Scribe generates the random value by
"rolling" four six-sided dice, throwing out the lowest number, and summing the
remaining three.  For other selection attributes, Scribe randomly selects one
of the possible values.  When selecting set values such as spells and feats,
Scribe uses other information about the character (e.g., feat count) to
randomly select the attribute values. The only text attribute that Scribe knows
how to randomize is the character name.  The names that the editor generates
are more often amusing than useful, but you can usually get a pretty decent
name from them with a little creative editing.
</p>

<a name="save"><h3>Saving Characters</h3></a>
<p>
For security purposes, web programs like Scribe are prohibited from creating
files on your hard disk.  This prevents Scribe from saving your character
directly; instead, the program displays the information that needs to be saved
in a separate window.  You can copy this information into your favorite file
editor and use it to save the character for later retrieval.
</p><p>
To save your character information, press the "View Html" button.  Scribe
opens a new window that contains the HTML for the character sheet; it also
contains the data Scribe needs to begin editing the character again later.
Copy and paste the contents of this window into your favorite editor and save
the result as a web page (a file with an extension of .html or .htm).  Later,
you can enter the URL of this file into Scribe's Open dialogue box to make
changes to the character.  You can also load the file directly into your
browser to view and print the character sheet.
</p>

<a name="sheet"><h3>The Character Sheet</h3></a>
<p>
The default character sheet format that Scribe produces contains six sections:
Header; Basic Attributes; Features and Skills; Combat; Magic; and Notes.  Each
of these lists related character attribute values, both entered and computed,
along with notes about the attributes.  Although most of the information on the
sheet should be clear, a few aspects of the format require explanation.
<ul>
  <li>In the Basic Attributes section, the computed modifier values for
      strength, wisdom, etc. are shown in parentheses after the attribute
      value.</li>
  <li>Whenever a computed attribute value differs from the one entered in the
      editor window, Scribe includes both values on the character
      sheet&#151;the computed value first, followed by the entered value in
      brackets.  For example, since a halfling gets a +2 bonus on dexterity,
      the sheet for a halfling character with an entered dexterity of 12 will
      show "Dexterity: 14[12]". The first number is the one that will usually
      be used during play.</li>
  <li>Some attribute notes appear in italics; others in plain text.  The
      italicized notes describe the effects of rules that Scribe used in
      computing attributes. For example, a sheet for a halfling character will
      include an italicized note reading "<i>Halfling Ability Adjustment: +2
      dexterity/-2 strength</i>". Italicized notes can normally be ignored
      during play, since Scribe has already incorporated the effect on the
      character sheet.  Plain text notes, on the other hand, describe rule
      effects that need to be applied during the game, so the DM should examine
      these closely.  For example, the Melee section of a halfling's character
      sheet will include the plain text note "Unafraid Feature: +2 vs. fear".
      When rolling a fear saving throw for this character, the DM will have to
      add two to the rolled value.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<a name="custom"><h3>Customization</h3></a>
<p>
Part of the fun of being the dungeon master is being able to customize the game
to your liking.  A lot of creativity can go into inventing new spells, new
magic items, new monsters and, depending on how ambitious you are, even new
attributes, classes, and races.  Scribe provides support for customizing the
editor display, the character sheet, and the rules it applies so that you can
get it working with the special modifications of your game.  Doing so involves
writing a bit of JavaScript code, but Scribe provides easy-to-use facilities
that allow you to apply significant customization without becoming a JavaScript
expert.
</p><p>
To add custom rules and information to Scribe, you need to fill in the
CustomizeScribe function found in scribe.html with commands that perform your
modifications.  Scribe invokes this function after loading.  From within
CustomizeScribe you can call several functions, each of which performs one type
of customization.
</p>

<a name="customchoices"><h3>Customization - Adding Choices</h3></a>
<p>
The easiest customization you can make is to add a choice to one of the basic
attribute lists Scribe displays.  For example, you might want to allow
characters to learn to speak the clicks and whistles used by dolphins and the
songs of whales.  To add these as languages to Scribe's Languages list,
thereby allowing users to select them for their characters, you would include
this code in your CustomizeScribe function:
</p><p><code>
PH35.defineChoice('languages', 'Dolphin', 'Whale');
</code></p><p>
Scribe will sort your additional choice(s) into the list.  The lists you can
modify in this fashion are 'alignments', 'domains' (cleric spell domains),
'feats', 'genders', 'goodies' (magic items), 'languages', 'races', 'schools'
(wizard spell schools), and 'shields'.
</p><p>
Other lists that you can modify require you to supply additional information
about the new choices.  For example, if you add new skills to Scribe's Skills
list, you must also supply the key ability associated with each skill.  When
you invoke PH35.defineChoice to modify these lists, follow each choice
in the list with a colon and the information associated with that choice.  The
lists you can modify in this fashion are 'deities' (include a slash-separated
set of domains after each new deity), 'skills' (include the key ability,
optionally followed by '/trained' if the skill cannot be used untrained),
'spells' (include a slash-separated set of spell levels).  and 'weapons'
(include a damage die for medium-sized creatures).  (The damage value for
weapons can also include a critical multiplier, preceded by 'x', a minimum
threat roll, preceded by '@', and/or a range increment, preceded by 'r'.  If
you don't include information about critical hits, Scribe assumes
'x2@20'&#151;the weapon potentially does double damage on a roll of 20 and is
not ranged.)  Here are examples of adding choices to these lists:
</p><p><code><pre>
PH35.defineChoice('deities',
  'Draum (CG Elf Dreams):Air/Chaos/Good/Luck',
  'Glennor (NG Healing):Air/Animal/Healing'
);
PH35.defineChoice('skills'
  'Craft (Alchemy):intelligence', 'Craft (Carpentery):intelligence',
  'Craft (Glassworking):intelligence', 'Herbalism:intelligence/trained',
  'Mediation:wisdom/trained'
);
PH35.defineChoice('spells', 'Calm Water:W6/Wa5', 'Darkstorm:C4/W4');
PH35.defineChoice('weapons', 'Catapult:4d12r240');
PH35.defineChoice('weapons', 'Shillelagh:d6');
PH35.defineChoice('weapons', 'Orc Kirak:d6x3@19');
</pre></code></p>

<a name="customrules"><h3>Customization - Adding Rules</h3></a>
<p>
Attributes like languages, skills, and spells generally don't affect other
attributes, so adding new choices to the lists users pick from is usually
sufficient.  When adding new choices to attributes like race, however, you will
probably want to add rules to reflect the effect selecting the new choice has
on other attributes.  You can do this by invoking the PH35.defineRule
function from within your CustomizeScribe function.
</p><p>
For example, suppose you decide to allow players to play goblin characters,
subtracting two from their strength score but adding two to dexterity.  The
CustomizeScribe lines to do this would be:
</p><p><code><pre>
PH35.defineChoice('races', 'Goblin');
PH35.defineRule('abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment', 'race', '=', 'source == "Goblin" ? "+2 dexterity/-2 strength" : null');
PH35.defineRule('strength', 'abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment', '+', '-2');
PH35.defineRule('dexterity', 'abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment', '+', '2');
</pre></code></p><p>
The first line simply adds 'Goblin' to the list of races available.  The next
line computes a new attribute that will be included in the notes of the
Attributes section of the character sheet, and the last two lines use this
attribute to modify the character abilities.  The parameters to PH35.defineRule
are the attribute affected, the attribute on which the first attribute depends,
the type of affect, and a JavaScript expression that calculates the value of
the effect.
</p><p>
For example, the first invocation of PH35.defineRule above computes a
value for the abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment attribute based on the value
of the race attribute. The third parameter ('=') indicates that race sets the
value of abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment to a specific value; other
possibilities are '+' (adds to the attribute value), '*' (multiplies the
attribute value), '^' (raises the attribute value to a minimum level), and 'v'
(lowers the attribute value to a maximum level).  The final parameter in the
first PH35.defineRule call tests to see if the race attribute's value is
"Goblin".  If so, it returns a string as the value of the
abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment attribute; otherwise, it returns null, a
value which indicates that the abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment attribute
does not apply to this character.  Within this piece of JavaScript, the
variable 'source' always refers to the attribute specified in the second
parameter.  So, in the first call above, 'source' refers to the value of the
race attribute.
</p><p>
Note that, if you didn't care about adding notes to the character sheet that
explain the race-based ability modifications, you could shorten the above four
lines to these three:
</p><p><code><pre>
PH35.defineChoice('races', 'Goblin');
PH35.defineRule('strength', 'race', '+', 'source == "Goblin" ? -2 : 0');
PH35.defineRule('dexterity', 'race', '+', 'source == "Goblin" ? 2 : 0');
</pre></code></p><p>
However, Scribe only retains one rule for each pair of modified/modifying
attributes, so this approach would work only for the first race you add.  If
you later added another rule that modified strength or dexterity based on race,
the new rule would replace the rule for goblins.  In general, it's best to add
rules that set new attributes (like abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment), then
use these new attributes to modify existing ones via a '+' rule.
</p><p>
<a href='scribeattrs.html'>scribeattrs.html</a> lists all the attributes that
Scribe knows about.  You can use any of these attributes, as well as new ones
you calculate, in calls to PH35.defineRule.
</p>

<a name="customtest"><h3>Customization - Adding Validation Tests</h3></a>
<p>
TODO Document PH35.defineTest(test /* , test ... */)
</p>

<a name="customsheet"><h3>Customization - Adding to the Character Sheet</h3></a>
<p>
Once you've computed new attributes for your character, you'll probably want to
include some of them on your character sheet.  You can do this through the
PH35.defineSheetElement function, which takes four parameters: the name
of the attribute, the section it should appear in, the attribute it should
appear before, and the format to use in the display.  For example, suppose you
had made calls to PH35.defineRule that computed a new character attribute
called 'spellPoints'. This code would insert the attribute into the Magic
section of the character sheet, just before cleric domains:
</p><p><code><pre>
PH35.defineSheetElement('spellPoints', 'Magic', 'Domains', null)
</pre></code></p><p>
Note that the final parameter here is <b>null</b>.  This indicates that Scribe
should use its default format to display the attribute, which is the attribute
name in boldface followed by a colon and the attribute value.  Chances are good
that this will usually be the format you want to use.  If you want to customize
the format, though, you can pass a string containing HTML that represents the
format.  Within this HTML the text %N represents the attribute name and %V its
value, so the default format is '&lt;b&gt;%N&lt;/b&gt;: %V'.
</p><p>
The predefined character sheet has six sections: 'Header', 'Attributes',
'FeaturesAndSkills', 'Combat', 'Magic', and 'NotesArea'.  You can add
attributes to any of these five by giving its name as the second parameter.
(You can also add a new section by calling PH35.defineSheetElement with a
second parameter of '_top'.) The third parameter indicates where, within the
section, the new attribute should be displayed.  This will usually be the name
of one of the attributes as displayed on the character sheet.  Alternatively,
you can place your new attribute at the end of the section by giving
<b>null</b> as the third parameter.
</p><p>
Adding attributes to the character sheet notes sections is done differently.
The six notes lists Scribe knows about are abilityNotes, featNotes, skillNotes,
combatNotes, saveNotes, and magicNotes.  To add an attribute to one of these
lists, simply give the attribute a name consisting of the list name followed by
a period and a description. 'abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment' used above
is one example of this&#151;Scribe would automatically include this attribute
in the ability notes.  If you want to specify a display format for a note
attribute (e.g., to include descriptive text), you can call
PH35.defineNote specifying the name of the attribute and its format,
like this
</p><p><code><pre>
PH35.defineNote
  ('abilityNotes.goblinAbilityAdjustment', '-2 strength/+2 dexterity');
</pre></code></p><p>
PH35.defineNote treats some attributes specially.  If the attribute
name ends with one of "Domain", "Feature", or "Synergy",
PH35.defineNote will automatically generate common rules related to the
attribute.  For "Domain" and "Feature" attributes, PH35.defineNote will
add a rule specifying that the note will appear only if the corresponding
domain or feature is in the character's list of attributes (e.g.,
'skillNotes.agileFeature' only appears if the character has the Agile feature).
"Synergy" attributes only appear if the character has at least five ranks in
the corresponding skill.  In addition, PH35.defineNote automatically
generates rules to adjust skill values based on skillNotes attributes.  If the
format of a skillNotes attribute gives a bonus value followed by a
slash-separated list of skill names, PH35.defineNote generates rules to
increase each of the skills in the list if the attribute is present.  For
example, given this call
</p><p><code><pre>
PH35.defineNote('skillNotes.agileFeature', '+2 Balance/Escape Artist');
</pre></code></p><p>
PH35.defineNote will generate rules to increase the Balance and Escape
Artist skills by two if the character has the Agile feature.
</p>

<a name="customclass"><h3>Customization - Adding Classes</h3></a>
<p>
Although the customization functions described above are sufficient to define
new character classes, Scribe provides the PH35.defineClass function as
a convenience.  This function takes 13 parameters: the name of the class; the
number of sides on the hit die; the number of skill points acquired each
level; JavaScript expressions to calculate the base attack bonus and fortitude,
reflex, and will saving throw bonuses; armor, shield, and weapon proficiency
levels; an array of class skills; an array of class features and the class
levels at which they are acquired; an optional array of tests for class
prerequisites.  Here is an example of code that defines the Dwarven Defender
prestige class defined in the Dungeon Master's Guide.
</p><p><code><pre>
  var features = [
    '1:Defensive Stance', '2:Uncanny Dodge', '4:Trap Sense',
    '6:Damage Reduction', '6:Improved Uncanny Dodge', '8:Mobile Defense'
  ];
  var notes = [
    'combatNotes.damageReductionFeature:%V subtracted from damage taken',
    'combatNotes.improvedUncannyDodgeFeature:' +
      'Flanked only by rogue four levels higher',
    'combatNotes.mobileDefenseFeature:' +
      'Allowed 5 ft. step during Defensive Stance',
    'combatNotes.uncannyDodgeFeature:Always adds dexterity modifier to AC',
    'featureNotes.defensiveStanceFeature:' +
      '+2 strength/+4 constitution/+2 saves/+4 dodge AC while unmoving ' +
      'for ConMod+3 rounds %V/day',
    'saveNotes.trapSenseFeature:+%V Reflex and AC vs. traps'
  ];
  var prerequisites = [
    '"{race}" == "Dwarf"',
    '"{alignment}".indexOf("Lawful") &gt;= 0',
    '{baseAttack} &gt;= 7',
    '{features.Dodge} != null',
    '{features.Endurance} != null',
    '{features.Toughness} != null'
  ];
  var skills = ['Craft', 'Listen', 'Sense Motive', 'Spot'];
  PH35.defineClass(
    'Dwarven Defender', 12, 2, PH35.ATTACK_BONUS_GOOD, PH35.SAVE_BONUS_GOOD,
    PH35.SAVE_BONUS_POOR, PH35.SAVE_BONUS_POOR, PH35.ARMOR_PROFICIENCY_HEAVY,
    PH35.SHIELD_PROFICIENCY_HEAVY, PH35.WEAPON_PROFICIENCY_MEDIUM, skills,
    features, prerequisites);
  );
  PH35.defineNote(notes);
  PH35.defineRule('armorClass',
    'combatNotes.dwarvenDefenderArmorClassAdjustment', '+', null
  );
  PH35.defineRule('combatNotes.dwarvenDefenderArmorClassAdjustment',
    'levels.Dwarven Defender', '=', 'Math.floor((source + 2) / 3)'
  );
  PH35.defineRule('combatNotes.damageReductionFeature',
    'levels.Dwarven Defender', '+=', 'source&lt;6 ? null : source&lt;10 ? 3 : 6'
  );
  PH35.defineRule('combatNotes.trapSenseFeature',
    'levels.Dwarven Defender', '+=',
      'source &gt;= 4 ? Math.floor(source / 4) : null'
  );
  PH35.defineRule('featureNotes.defensiveStanceFeature',
    'levels.Dwarven Defender', '+=', 'Math.floor((source + 1) / 2)'
  );
</pre></code></p><p>
As shown in this example, you will usually follow a call to
PH35.defineClass with one or more calls to the other customization
functions to compute class-related attributes. Scribe provides a set of
constants you can use for the JavaScript parameters to PH35.defineClass
that correspond to the values used in the Player's Handbook for the base
classes:
PH35.ATTACK_BONUS_GOOD, PH35.ATTACK_BONUS_AVERAGE, PH35.ATTACK_BONUS_POOR,
PH35.PROFICIENCY_HEAVY, PH35.PROFICIENCY_LIGHT, PH35.PROFICIENCY_MEDIUM,
PH35.PROFICIENCY_NONE, PH35.PROFICIENCY_TOWER, PH35.SAVE_BONUS_GOOD,
PH35.SAVE_BONUS_POOR

<a name="custommagic"><h3>Customization - Adding Magic Items</h3></a>
<p>
The Dungeon Master's guide contains a large selection of magic items, and most
DMs generate their own additional magic items from time to time.  Because of
this, Scribe presents only a minimal selection of magic items in its "Goodies"
menu, leaving it to the DM to customize the list to include the specific items
that appear in his or her campaign.  See the other customization sections for
information on how to add additional items to the Goodies list and the rules
that specify the effects of new items.

<a name="limitations"><h3>Limitations</h3></a>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The skills and feats that require you to pick a subject (e.g., "Craft",
      "Weapon Focus") are not included in the skill and feat lists.  DMs should
      use customization to add particular instances of these skills and feats,
      e.g., "Craft (Carpentery)", "Weapon Focus (Longsword)".  This applies to:
      the skills "Craft" and "Profession"; the weapon feats "Greater Weapon
      Focus", "Greater Weapon Specialization", "Improved Critical", "Weapon
      Focus", "Weapon Proficiency Exotic", "Weapon Proficiency Martial", and
      "Weapon Specialization"; the spell feats "Greater Spell Focus", "Spell
      Focus" and "Spell Mastery"; the skill feat "Skill Focus".
  <li>When an character ability score is modified, Scribe recalculates
      attributes based on that ability from scratch.  For example, bumping
      intelligence when a character reaches 4th level causes Scribe to
      recompute the number of skill points awarded at first level.  This
      might be considered a feature.</li>
  <li>Race- and class-based proficiencies for specific weapons are not
      reported.</li>
  <li>Scribe uses the dexterity modifier to attack throws for all weapons of
      characters with the "Weapon Finesse" feat, not just light weapons.</li>
  <li>The armor class of characters with the "Dodge" feat includes a +1 bonus
      that doesn't apply to more than one foe at a time.</li>
  <li>Racial favored class is not reported.</li>
  <li>Scribe provides no place other than the notes section to enter mundane
      possessions like lanterns and rope. The same goes for physical
      description.</li>
  <li>You can only select the feats "Extra Turning" and "Toughness" once.
      Multiple selections of these feats can be handled by defining custom
      feats (e.g., "Improved Toughness").</li>
  <li>Although they have a range increment, the weapons Club, Dagger, Light
      Hammer, Shortspear, Spear, and Trident are all considered melee weapons.
      Substitute the ranged attack attribute for the melee attack attribute
      given on the character sheet when any of these is thrown.</li>
  <li>Scribe updates the cross-class skill indicators in the editor skill
      pull-down menu whenever a character is generated or loaded and when class
      levels or cleric domains change.  This is sufficient for the PH rules,
      but the menu may not reflect any custom rules that make the
      class/cross-class determination depend on other attributes.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="todo"><h3>Bugs/To-do List</h3></a>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Scribe gives multi-class characters quadruple spell points for the first
      level in each class, instead of just one class.</li>
  <li>Scribe presently defines no way to add additional types of armor because
      of all the extra information that would need to be specified&#151;arcane
      spell failure percentage, a.c. bonus, maximum dexterity bonus, skill
      check penalty, etc.</li>
  <li>Scribe has problems dealing with attributes containing an uncapitalized
      word.  This is why, e.g., Scribe defines the skills "Sleight Of Hand" and
      "Knowledge (Arcana)" instead of "Sleight of Hand" and "Knowledge
      (arcana)". There are other occasions when Scribe is picky about case;
      when defining your own attributes, it's safest to follow the conventions
      Scribe uses.</li>
</ul>
