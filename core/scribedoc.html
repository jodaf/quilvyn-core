<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>
Scribe is a web-based editor for AD&amp;D characters.  It allows you to enter
and modify basic information about a character&#151;race, class levels,
attributes like strength, and so on&#151;and applies the rules from the third
edition Player's Handbook to modify these basic attributes and calculate
generated attributes like saving throw bonuses and armor class.  The program
formats character attributes into a compact (typically one page) character
sheet web page that you can print for reference during game play.  You can save
this web page in a file and later reload it into Scribe to update the
character's attributes.  Customization features allow you to incorporate "house
rules" into both the editor and character sheet.
</p>


<a name="install"><h3>Installing and Running Scribe</h3></a>
<p>
A tar file containing the Scribe code can be obtained from
<a href='http://www.jodaf.com/dnd/scribe/scribe.tar'>www.jodaf.com/dnd/scribe/scribe.tar</a>.
The Scribe program consists of eight files: DndCharacter.js, ObjectViewer.js,
RuleEngine.js, Scribe.js, gpl.txt, help.html, scribe.gif, and scribe.html.  It
is possible to install only scribe.html and direct Scribe to download the other
files when the program runs.  Doing so ensures that you get the latest version
of Scribe every time you run the program; however, it also means that you have
to wait for the download each time. See scribe.html for details.
</p>

<p>
Scribe has been successfully tested using these browers
<ul>
  <li>Linux Galeon v1.2 and v1.3</li>
  <li>Linux Mozilla v1.0 and v1.7</li>
  <li>Macintosh OS X Internet Explorer v5.2</li>
  <li>Macintosh OS X Safari v1.2</li>
  <li>Windows Firefox v1.0</li>
  <li>Windows Internet Explorer v6.0</li>
  <li>Windows Opera v7.54</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
scribe.html contains a section of definitions that allow you to set some user
preferences.  Scribe uses the BACKGROUND setting as the background color for
its windows, and the program uses the URL_PREFIX and URL_SUFFIX values to
expand abbreviated values entered in the open dialogue.  For example, if
URL_PREFIX is "file:///home/farquar/Scribe/charcters/" and URL_SUFFIX is
".html", than you can simply enter "jorash" into the open dialogue to open the
character file "file:///home/farquar/Scribe/characters/jorash.html".  The value
of MAX_RECENT_OPENS determines how many recently-opened character URLs appear
in the New/Open menu.  You can also add character sheet and editor
customizations in scribe.html.  See the <a href="#custom">customization
section</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
Other definitions in scribe.html allow you to select the rules from the v3.0 or
v3.5 version of the Player's Handbook.  The value of CLASS_RULES_VERSION
determines which class and race rules Scribe uses, the value of
FEAT_RULES_VERSION determines the feat and skills rules, and the value of
MAGIC_RULES_VERSION determines the rules for magic spells and domains.  You
should set each of these to either '3.0' or '3.5', depending on your version
preference.  Scribe also allows you to combine rules from the two versions
(e.g., use feats from both the v3.0 and v3.5 Player's Handbooks) by listing
both versions separated by a slash (e.g., '3.0/3.5').  If you do this, the
version listed last takes precedence for any rules that are incompatible
between the versions.
</p>

<p>
To run Scribe, simply use your favorite web browser to open scribe.html.
</p>


<a name="open"><h3>Generating and Loading Characters</h3></a>
<p>
Generating new characters and loading previously saved ones are both handled
through Scribe's New/Open menu.  The choices in this menu allow you to generate
a new character with random attribute values, enter the URL of an existing
character file, or reopen the file of a recently-opened character. The URL for
character files will usually begin with "file://", followed by the path to the
file where you previously saved the character (see <a href="#save">Saving
Characters</a> below).  When you ask for a new, randomized character, Scribe
opens a form that allows you to specify the character's race and/or class
level(s).  This helps DMs to use Scribe to generate NPCs.  You can either
specify these attributes, or leave the form blank to have Scribe generate them
randomly.
</p>


<a name="edit"><h3>Editing Characters</h3></a>
<p>
The Scribe editing window contains editing objects that allow you to change
basic character attributes.  The editor uses three different types of editing
objects.  <i>Text fields</i> are used for attributes, such as name and player,
that have an infinite number of possible values.  To modify one of these
attributes, simply type the new value into the text field.  In text fields
that contain a number (e.g., experience points) you can instead enter a '+'
followed by a number, and Scribe will add the number to the existing value of
the field.  <i>Selection menus</i> are used with attributes like alignment,
race, and abilities like strength and intelligence.  These editing objects give
you a pull-down menu that contains all the possible values.  Simply select the
correct one to change the attribute. <i>Set menus</i> are used for collections
of related attributes like skills, feats, weapons, and class levels.  Along
with a pull-down menu, these editing objects include either a checkbox or a
small text field where you can enter a value.  A checkbox is used for
attributes, such as spells, where the character either has an attribute or not;
the text field is used with attributes (e.g., skills, class levels) where the
character has a variable score associated with the attribute.  To change one of
these attributes, first use the pull-down menu to select a particular
attribute, then click the checkbox or enter a value in the text field.
</p>

<p>
In your main browser window, Scribe displays a character sheet based on the
values of the editing window.  Every time you change a value in the editing
window, Scribe applies the rules from the AD&amp;D third edition Player's
Handbook, then updates the character sheet to show you any computed changes.
</p>

<p>
A few items in the editor window don't relate directly to the character sheet.
The "New/Open" button is discussed in in <a href='#open'>Generating and
Loading Characters</a> and the "View HTML" button in <a href='#save'>Saving
Characters</a>.  The "Help" button opens a window that contains this
document, and the "About" button opens one with the usual text describing the
program.  The "Validate" button checks the current character values against
restrictions from the Player's Handbook.  Scribe allows you to enter a
character that doesn't meet these restrictions (e.g., a chaotic monk), but will
warn you when you press this button.  Finally, the "Spell Categories" set menu
allows you to determine which spells appear in the "Spells" set menu.  Since
hundreds of spells and variations are available, this menu allows you to select
the categories of spells (e.g. cleric spells, air domain spells) of interest.
Whenever a character is loaded or generated, Scribe resets this menu to include
only those spells (if any) that the character may know.
</p>


<a name="random"><h3>Clearing and Randomizing Attributes</h3></a>
<p>
The "Clear" menu gives you a quick way to reset attributes to their default
values.  For example, selecting "Spells" in the "Clear" menu will uncheck all
options in the Spells editing menu and remove all spells from the character
sheet.
</p>

<p>
The "Randomize" menu allows you to let Scribe randomly determine most basic
Scribe character attributes.  The editor will select a random value for the
attribute you select and update both the editing display and the character
sheet.  For the six basic attributes&#151;strength, intelligence, wisdom,
constitution, dexterity, and charisma&#151;Scribe generates the random value by
"rolling" four six-sided dice, throwing out the lowest number, and summing the
remaining three.  For other selection attributes, Scribe randomly selects one
of the possible values.  When selecting set values such as spells and feats,
Scribe uses other information about the character (e.g., feat count) to
randomly select the attribute values. The only text attribute that Scribe knows
how to randomize is the character name.  The names that the editor generates
are more often amusing than useful, but you can usually get a pretty decent
name from them with a little creative editing.
</p>


<a name="save"><h3>Saving Characters</h3></a>
<p>
For security purposes, web programs like Scribe are prohibited from creating
files on your hard disk.  This prevents Scribe from saving your character
directly; instead, the program displays the information that needs to be saved
in a separate window.  You can copy this information into your favorite file
editor and use it to save the character for later retrieval.
</p>

<p>
To save your character information, press the "View Html" button.  Scribe
opens a new window that contains the HTML for the character sheet; it also
contains the data Scribe needs to begin editing the character again later.
Copy and paste the contents of this window into your favorite editor and save
the result as a web page (a file with an extension of .html or .htm).  Later,
you can enter the URL of this file into Scribe's Open dialogue box to make
changes to the character.  You can also load the file directly into your
browser to view and print the character sheet.
</p>


<a name="sheet"><h3>The Character Sheet</h3></a>
<p>
The default character sheet format that Scribe produces contains six sections:
Header; Basic Attributes; Feats and Skills; Melee; Magic; and Notes.  Each of
these lists related character attribute values, both entered and computed,
along with notes about the attributes.  Although most of the information on the
sheet should be clear, a few aspects of the format require explanation.
<ul>
  <li>In the Basic Attributes section, the computed modifier values for
      strength, wisdom, etc. are shown in parentheses after the attribute
      value.</li>
  <li>Whenever a computed attribute value differs from the one entered in the
      editor window, Scribe includes both values on the character
      sheet&#151;the computed value first, followed by the entered value in
      brackets.  For example, since a halfling gets a +2 bonus on dexterity,
      the sheet for a halfling character with an entered dexterity of 12 will
      show "Dexterity: 14[12]". The first number is the one that will usually
      be used during play.</li>
  <li>Some attribute notes appear in italics; others in plain text.  The
      italicized notes describe the effects of rules that Scribe used in
      computing attributes. For example, a sheet for a halfling character will
      include an italicized note reading "<i>Halfling Ability: +2 dex/-2
      str</i>". Italicized notes can normally be ignored during play, since
      Scribe has already incorporated the effect on the character sheet. Plain
      text notes, on the other hand, describe rule effects that need to be
      applied during the game, so the DM should examine these closely.  For
      example, the Melee section of a halfling's character sheet will include
      the plain text note "Halfling Save: +3 fear/+1 others." When rolling a
      spell saving throw for this character, the DM will have to add either 1
      or 3 to the rolled value.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<a name="custom"><h3>Customization</h3></a>
<p>
Part of the fun of being the dungeon master is being able to customize the game
to your liking.  A lot of creativity can go into inventing new spells, new
magic items, new monsters and, depending on how ambitious you are, even new
attributes, classes, and races.  Scribe provides support for customizing the
editor display, the character sheet, and the rules it applies so that you can
get it working with the special modifications of your game.  Doing so involves
writing a bit of JavaScript code, but Scribe provides easy-to-use facilities
that allow you to apply significant customization without becoming a JavaScript
expert.
</p>

<p>
To add custom rules and information to Scribe, you need to fill in the
CustomizeScribe function found in scribe.html with commands that perform your
modifications.  Scribe invokes this function after loading.  CustomizeScribe
has three parameters, each of which is a function that you can invoke to
perform one type of customization.
</p>

<p>
The easiest customization you can make is to add a choice to one of the basic
attribute lists Scribe displays.  For example, you might want to allow
characters to learn to speak the clicks and whistles used by dolphins and the
songs of whales.  To add these as languages to Scribe's Languages list,
thereby allowing users to select them for their characters, you would include
this code in your CustomizeScribe function:
</p>

<p><code>
AddChoices('languages', 'Dolphin', 'Whale');
</code></p>

<p>
Scribe will sort your additional choice(s) into the list.  The lists you can
modify in this fashion are 'alignments', 'domains' (cleric spell domains),
'feats', 'genders', 'goodies' (magic items), 'languages', 'races', 'schools'
(wizard spell schools), and 'shields'.
</p>

<p>
Other lists that you can modify require you to supply additional information
about the new choices.  For example, if you add new skills to Scribe's Skills
list, you must also supply the key ability associated with each skill.  When
you invoke AddChoice to modify these lists, give the information associated
with each choice immediately after the choice.  The lists you can modify in
this fashion are 'deities' (include a slash-separated set of domains after
each new deity), 'skills' (include the key ability), 'spells' (include a
slash-separated set of spell levels).  and 'weapons' (include a damage die
for medium-sized creatures).  (The damage value for weapons can also include a
critical multiplier, preceded by 'x', and/or a minumum threat roll, preceded by
'@'.  If you don't include information about critical hits, Scribe assumes
'x2@20'&#151;the weapon potentially does double damage on a roll of 20.)  Here
are examples of adding choices to these lists:
</p>

<p><code><pre>
AddChoices('deities',
  'Draum (CG Elf Dreams)', 'Air/Chaos/Good/Luck',
  'Glennor (NG Healing)', 'Air/Animal/Healing'
);
AddChoices('skills'
  'Craft (alchemy)', 'int', 'Craft (carpentery)', 'int',
  'Craft (glassworking)', 'int', 'Herbalism', 'int', 'Mediation', 'wis'
);
AddChoices('spells' 'Calm Water', 'W6/Wa5', 'Darkstorm', 'C4/W4');
AddChoices('weapons' 'Shillelagh', 'd6');
AddChoices('weapons' 'Orc Kirak', 'd6x3@19');
</pre></code></p>

<p>
Attributes like languages, skills, and spells generally don't affect other
attributes, so adding new choices to the lists users pick from is usually
sufficient.  When adding new choices to attributes like race, however, you will
probably want to add rules to reflect the effect selecting the new choice has
on other attributes.  You can do this by invoking the AddRules function from
within your CustomizeScribe function.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose you decide to allow players to play goblin characters,
subtracting two from their strength score but adding two to constitution.  The
CustomizeScribe lines to do this would be:
</p>
 
<p><code><pre>
AddChoices('races', 'Goblin');
AddRules('abilityNotes.goblinAbility', 'race', '=', 'source == "Goblin" ? "+2 constitution/-2 strength" : null');
AddRules('strength', 'abilityNotes.goblinAbility', '+', '2');
AddRules('dexterity', 'abilityNotes.goblinAbility', '+', '2');
</pre></code></p>

<p>
The first line simply adds 'Goblin' to the list of races available.  The next
line computes a new attribute that will be included in the notes of the
Attributes section of the character sheet, and the last two lines use this
attribute to modify the character abilities.  The parameters to AddRules are
the attribute affected, the attribute on which the first attribute depends, the
type of affect, and a JavaScript expression that calculates the value of the
effect.
</p>

<p>
For example, the first invocation of AddRules above computes a value for the
abilityNotes.goblinAbility attribute based on the value of the race attribute.
The third parameter ('=') indicates that race sets the value of
abilityNotes.goblinAbility to a specific value; other possibilities are '+'
(adds to the attribute value), '*' (multiplies the attribute value), '^'
(raises the attribute value to a minimum level), and 'v' (lowers the attribute
value to a maximum level).  The final parameter in the first AddRules call
tests to see if the race attribute's value is "Goblin".  If so, it returns a
string as the value of the abilityNotes.goblinAbility attribute; otherwise, it
returns null, a value which indicates that the abilityNotes.goblinAbility
attribute does not apply to this character.  Within this piece of JavaScript,
the variable 'source' always refers to the attribute specified in the second
parameter.  So, in the first call above, 'source' refers to the value of the
race attribute.
</p>

<p>
Note that, if you didn't care about adding notes to the character sheet that
explain the race-based ability modifications, you could shorten the above four
lines to these three:
</p>

<p><code><pre>
AddChoices('races', 'Goblin');
AddRules('strength', 'race', '+', 'source == "Goblin" ? -2 : 0');
AddRules('dexterity', 'race', '+', 'source == "Goblin" ? 2 : 0');
</pre></code></p>

<p>
However, Scribe only retains one rule for each pair of modified/modifying
attributes, so this approach would work only for the first race you add.  If
you later added another rule that modified strength or dexterity based on race,
the new rule would replace the rule for goblins.  In general, it's best to add
rules that set new attributes (like abilityNotes.goblinAbility), then use these
new attributes to modify existing ones via a '+' rule.
</p>

<p>
Once you've computed new attributes for your character, you'll probably want to
include some of them on your character sheet.  You can do this through the
AddToSheet function, which takes four parameters: the name of the attribute,
the section it should appear in, the attribute it should appear before, and the
format to use in the display.  For example, suppose you had made calls to
AddRules that computed a new character attribute called 'spellPoints'. This
code would insert the attribute into the Magic section of the character sheet,
just before cleric domains:
</p>

<p><code><pre>
AddToSheet('spellPoints', 'Magic', 'Domains', null)
</pre></code></p>

<p>
Note that the final parameter here is <b>null</b>.  This indicates that Scribe
should use its default format to display the attribute, which is the attribute
name in boldface followed by a colon and the attribute value.  Chances are good
that this will usually be the format you want to use.  If you want to customize
the format, though, you can pass a string containing HTML that represents the
format.  Within this HTML the text %N represents the attribute name and %V its
value, so the default format is '&lt;b&gt;%N&lt;/b&gt;: %V'.
</p>

<p>
The predefined character sheet has six sections: 'Header', 'Attributes',
'FeatsAndSkills', 'Melee', 'Magic', and 'Notes'.  You can add attributes to any
of these five by giving its name as the second parameter. (You can also add a
new section by calling AddToSheet with a second parameter of '_top'.) The third
parameter indicates where, within the section, the new attribute should be
displayed.  This will usually be the name of one of the attributes as displayed
on the character sheet.  Alternatively, you can place your new attribute at the
end of the section by giving <b>null</b> as the third parameter.
</p>

<a name="magicitems"><h3>Adding Magic Items</h3></a>
<p>
The Dungeon Master's guide contains a large selection of magic items, and most
DMs generate their own additional magic items from time to time.  Because of
this, Scribe presents only a minimal selection of magic items in its "Goodies"
menu, leaving it to the DM to customize the list to include the specific items
that appear in his or her campaign.  See the
<a href='#custom'>Customization</a> section for information on how to add
additional items to the Goodies list and the rules that specify the effects of
new items.
</p>

<a name="limitations"><h3>Limitations</h3></a>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Neither "Craft" nor "Profession" appears in Scribe's skill list; it is
      assumed that DMs will use customization to add particular crafts (e.g.,
      'Craft (carpentery)') and professions (e.g., 'Profession (lawyer)').</li>
  <li>When an character ability score is modified, Scribe recalculates
      attributes based on that ability from scratch.  For example, bumping
      intelligence when a character reaches fourth level causes Scribe to
      recompute the number of skill points awarded at first level.  This
      might be considered a feature.</li>
  <li>Race- and class-based weapon proficiencies are not reported.</li>
  <li>Some v3.5 modifications are used even if you select v3.0 rules: the
      expanded language list, the updated armor and weapon information,
      the +4 A.C. bonus for tower shields; the renaming of the feat "Expertise"
      to "Combat Expertise"; the renaming of the skills "Pick Pocket" and
      "Wilderness Lore" to "Sleight Of Hand" and "Survival".</li>
  <li>Racial favored class is not reported.</li>
  <li>Large/tiny damage is not reported.  Characters are assumed to be small
      (gnomes, halflings) or medium (all others).</li>
  <li>Spells per day computations are off by one for some high-level (19-20)
      characters.</li>
  <li>Scribe provides no place other than the notes section to enter mundane
      possessions like lanterns and rope. The same goes for physical
      description.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="todo"><h3>Bugs/To-do List</h3></a>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Spell schools are not indicated.  It would be particularly nice to flag
      spells within a Wizard's specialization.</li>
  <li>The customization section of the help file needs descriptions of the
      other tables that can/must be modified&#151;classesClassSkills/HitDie,
      weaponsRangeIncrement, and all the garbage that goes with armor. Also,
      there should be discussion of the names of the entered and computed
      character attributes so that users know what to pass to AddRules.</li>
  <li>It's easy to overlook when characters have a bonus in untrained skills,
      e.g., an elf's +2 on <i>Listen</i> when no skill points are allocated to
      that skill.</li>
  <li>It might be nice to ask the user about discarding changes to the current
      character when opening a new one or exiting Scribe.</li>
  <li>Scribe has problems dealing with options containing a space followed by
      an uncapitalized word.  This is why, e.g., the skill "Sleight Of Hand"
      doesn't appear as "Sleight of Hand".</li>
</ul>
