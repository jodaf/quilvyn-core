<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>
Scribe is a web-based editor for AD&amp;D characters.  It allows you to enter
and modify basic information about a character&#151;race, class levels,
attributes like strength, and so on&#151;and applies the rules from the third
edition Players' Handbook to modify these basic attributes and calculate
generated attributes like saving throw bonuses and armor class.  The program
formats character attributes into a compact (typically one page) character
sheet web page that you can print for reference during game play.  You can save
this web page in a file and later reload it into Scribe to update the
character's attributes.  Customization features allow you to incorporate "house
rules" into both the editor and character sheet.
</p>


<a name="install"><h3>Installing and Running Scribe</h3></a>
<p>
The Scribe program consists of nine files: DndCharacter.js, FormController.js,
ObjectViewer.js, RuleEngine.js, Scribe.js, gpl.txt, help.html, scribe.gif, and
scribe.html.  These can be downloaded from the Scribe website, either
individually or together in a tar ball.  It is possible to install only
scribe.html and direct Scribe to download the other files during installation.
Doing so ensures that you get the latest version of Scribe every time you run
the program; however, it also means that you have to wait for the download each
time.  See scribe.html for details.
</p>

<p>
scribe.html contains a section of definitions that allow you to set some user
preferences.  Scribe uses the BACKGROUND setting as the background color for
its windows, and the program uses the URL_PREFIX and URL_SUFFIX settings to
expand abbreviated values entered in the open dialogue.  For example, if
URL_PREFIX is "file:///home/farquar/Scribe/charcters/" and URL_SUFFIX is
".html", than you can simply enter "jorash" into the open dialogue to open the
character file "file:///home/farquar/Scribe/characters/jorash.html".  You can
also add character sheet and editor customizations in scribe.html.  See the
<a href="#custom">customization section</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
To run Scribe, simply use your favorite web browser to open scribe.html.
</p>

<a name="open"><h3>Generating and Loading Characters</h3></a>
<p>
Generating new characters and loading previously saved ones are both handled
through Scribe's New/Open dialogue box.  Press the "New/Open" button.  Scribe
opens a dialogue box that asks for the URL of a character file you would
like to edit.  To generate a new character, leave the URL box blank and
press "OK".  Scribe will generate a character with random values selected for
all editable attributes.  To make changes to an existing character, enter the
URL to the HTML file you previously saved (see <a href="#save">Saving
Characters</a> below).  Normally, this URL will begin with "file://",
followed by the path to your HTML file.
</p>


<a name="edit"><h3>Editing Characters</h3></a>
<p>
The Scribe editing window contains editing objects that allow you to change
basic character attributes.  The editor uses three different types of editing
objects.  <i>Text fields</i> are used for attributes such as name, deity, and
player that have a wide range of possible values.  To modify one of these
attributes, simply type the new value into the text field. <i>Selection
menus</i> are used with attributes like alignment, class, race, and abilities
like strength and intelligence.  These editing objects give you a pull-down
menu that contain all the possible values.  Simply select the correct one to
change the attribute.  <i>Set menus</i> are used for collections of related
attributes like skills, feats, weapons, and class levels.  Along with a
pull-down menu, these editing objects include either a checkbox or a small
text field where you can enter a value.  A checkbox is used for attributes,
like spells, where the character either has an attribute or not, while the
text field is used with attributes (e.g., skills, class levels) where the
character has a variable score associated with the attribute.  To change one of
these attributes, first use the pull-down menu to select a particular
attribute, then click the checkbox or enter a value in the text field.
</p>

<p>
In your main browser window, Scribe displays a character sheet based on the
values of the editing window.  Every time you change a value in the editing
window, Scribe applies the rules from the AD&amp;D third edition Players'
Handbook, then updates the character sheet to show you any computed changes.
</p>


<a name="random"><h3>Randomizing Attributes</h3></a>
<p>
The "Randomize" menu allows you to let Scribe randomly determine most basic
character attributes.  Using the menu, select the attribute that you would like
Scribe to randomize.  The editor will select a random value for the attribute
you select and update both the editing display and the character sheet.  For
the six basic attributes&#151;strength, intelligence, wisdom, constitution,
dexterity, and charisma&#151;Scribe generates the random value by "rolling"
four six-sided dice, throwing out the lowest number, and summing the remaining
three.  For other selection attributes, Scribe randomly selects one of the
possible values.  The only non-selection attribute that Scribe knows how to
randomize is the character name.  The names that the editor generates are more
often amusing than useful, but you can usually get a pretty decent name from
them with a little creative editing.
</p>


<a name="save"><h3>Saving Characters</h3></a>
<p>
For security purposes, web programs like Scribe are prohibited from creating
files on your hard disk.  This prevents Scribe from saving your character
directly; instead, the program displays the information that needs to be saved
in a separate window.  You can copy this information into your favorite file
editor and use it to save the character for later retrieval.
</p>

<p>
To save your character information, press the "View Html" button.  Scribe
opens a new window that contains the HTML for the character sheet; it also
contains the data Scribe needs to begin editing the character again later.
Copy and paste the contents of this window into your favorite editor and save
the result as a web page (a file with an extension of .html or .htm).  Later,
you can enter the URL of this file into Scribe's Open dialogue box to make
changes to the character.  You can also load the file directly into your
browser to view and print the character sheet.
</p>


<a name="sheet"><h3>The Character Sheet</h3></a>
<p>
The default character sheet format that Scribe produces contains six sections:
Header; Basic Attributes; Feats and Skills; Melee; Magic; and Notes.  Each of
these lists related character attribute values, both entered and computed,
along with notes about the attributes.  Although most of the information on the
sheet should be clear, a few aspects of the format require explanation.
<ul>
  <li>In the Basic Attributes section, the computed modifier values for
      strength, wisdom, etc. are shown in parentheses after the attribute
      value.</li>
  <li>Whenever a computed attribute value differs from the one entered in the
      editor window, Scribe includes both values on the character
      sheet&#151;the computed value first, followed by the entered value in
      brackets.  For example, since a halfling gets a +2 bonus on dexterity,
      the sheet for a halfling character with an entered dexterity of 12 will
      show "Dexterity: 14[12]". The first number is the one that will usually
      be used during play.</li>
  <li>Some attribute notes appear in italics; others in plain text.  The
      italicized notes describe the effects of rules that Scribe used in
      computing attributes. For example, a sheet for a halfling character will
      include an italicized note reading "<i>Halfling Dexterity: +2</i>".
      Italicized notes can normally be ignored during play, since Scribe has
      already incorporated the effect on the character sheet. Plain text notes,
      on the other hand, describe rule effects that need to be applied during
      the game, so the DM should examine these closely.  For example, the Melee
      section of a halfling's character sheet will include the plain text note
      "Halfling Save: +3 Fear/+1 All Others." When rolling a spell saving throw
      for this character, the DM will have to add either 1 or 3 to the rolled
      value.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="custom"><h3>Customization</h3></a>
<p>
Part of the fun of being the dungeon master is being able to customize the game
to your liking.  A lot of creativity can go into inventing new spells, new
magic items, new monsters and, depending on how ambitious you are, even new
attributes, classes, and races.  Scribe provides support for customizing the
editor display, the character sheet, and the rules it applies so that you can
get it working with the special modifications of your game.  Doing so involves
writing a bit of JavaScript code, but Scribe provides easy-to-use facilities
that allow you to apply significant customization without becoming a JavaScript
expert.
</p>

<p>
To add custom rules and information to Scribe, you need to fill in the
CustomizeScribe function found in scribe.html with commands that perform your
modifications.  Scribe invokes this function after loading.  CustomizeScribe
has three parameters, each of which is a function that you can invoke to
perform one type of customization.
</p>

<p>
The easiest customization you can make is to add a choice to one of the basic
attribute lists Scribe displays.  For example, you might invent languages
called "Aquan", and "Avian", spoken by denizens of the sea and air,
respectively.  To add these two languages to Scribe's Languages list, thereby
allowing users to select them for their characters, you would include this code
in your CustomizeScribe function:
</p>

<p><code>
AddChoices('languages', 'Aquan', 'Avian');
</code></p>

<p>
Scribe will sort your additional choice(s) into the list.  The lists you can
modify in this fashion are 'alignments', 'armors', 'classes', 'domains' (cleric
spell domains), 'feats', 'genders', 'goodies' (magic items), 'helms',
'languages', 'races', 'schools' (wizard spell schools), 'shields', 'skills',
'spells', and 'weapons'.
</p>

<p>
Attributes like languages, skills, and spells generally don't affect other
attributes, so adding new choices to the lists users pick from is usually
sufficient.  When adding new choices to attributes like race, however, you will
probably want to add rules to reflect the affect choosing the new choice has on
other attributes.  You can do this by invoking the AddRules function from
within your CustomizeScribe function.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose you decide to allow players to play goblin characters,
subtracting two from their strength score but adding two to dexterity.  The
CustomizeScribe lines to do this would be:
</p>
 
<p><code><pre>
AddChoices('races', 'Goblin');
AddRules('abilityNotes.goblinStrength', 'race', '=', 'source == "Goblin" ? -2 : null');
AddRules('abilityNotes.goblinDexterity', 'race', '=', 'source == "Goblin" ? 2 : null');
AddRules('strength', 'abilityNotes.goblinStrength', '+', 'source');
AddRules('dexterity', 'abilityNotes.goblinDexterity', '+', 'source');
</pre></code></p>

<p>
The first line simply adds 'Goblin' to the list of races available.  The next
two lines compute new attributes that will be included in the notes at the
bottom of the Attributes section of the character sheet, and the last two lines
use these attributes to modify the character abilities.  The parameters to
AddRules are the attribute affected, the attribute on which the first attribute
depends, the type of affect, and a short piece of JavaScript that calculates
the amount of the affect.
</p>

<p>
For example, the first invocation of AddRules above computes a value for the
abilityNotes.goblinStrength attribute based on the value of the race attribute.
The third parameter ('=') indicates that race sets the value of
abilityNotes.goblinStrength to a specific value; other possibilities are '+'
(adds to the attribute value), '*' (multiplies the attribute value), '^'
(raises the attribute value to a minimum level), and 'v' (lowers the attribute
value to a maximum level).  The final parameter in the first AddRules call
tests to see if the race attribute's value is "Goblin".  If so, it returns -2
as the value of the abilityNotes.goblinStrength attribute; otherwise, it
returns null, a value which indicates that the abilityNotes.goblinStrength
attribute does not apply to this character.  Within this piece of JavaScript,
the variable 'source' always refers to the attribute specified in the second
parameter.  So, in the first two calls above, 'source' refers to the value of
the race attribute, but in the third 'source' refers to the value of the
abilityNotes.goblinStrength attribute and in the fourth it refers to the value
of the abilityNotes.goblinDexterity attribute.
</p>

<p>
Note that, if you didn't care about adding notes to the character sheet that
explain the race-based ability modifications, you could shorten the above five
lines to these three:
</p>

<p><code><pre>
AddChoices('races', 'Goblin');
AddRules('strength', 'race', '+', 'source == "Goblin" ? -2 : 0');
AddRules('dexterity', 'race', '+', 'source == "Goblin" ? 2 : 0');
</pre></code></p>

<p>
However, Scribe only retains one rule for each pair of modified/modifying
attributes, so this approach would work only for the first race you add.  If
you later added another rule that modified strength or dexterity based on race,
the new rule would replace the rule for goblins.  In general, it's best to add
rules that set new attributes (like abilityNotes.goblinStrength), then use
these new attributes to modify existing ones via a '+' rule.
</p>

<p>
Once you've computed new attributes for your character, you'll probably want to
include some of them on your character sheet.  You can do this through the
AddToSheet function, which takes four parameters: the name of the attribute,
the section it should appear in, the attribute it should appear before, and the
format to use in the display.  For example, suppose you had made calls to
AddRules that computed a new character attribute called 'spellPoints'. This
code would insert the attribute into the Magic section of the character sheet,
just before cleric domains:
</p>

<p><code><pre>
AddToSheet('spellPoints', 'Magic', 'Domains', null)
</pre></code></p>

<p>
Note that the final parameter here is <b>null</b>.  This indicates that Scribe
should use its default format to display the attribute, which is the attribute
name in boldface followed by a colon and the attribute value.  Chances are good
that this will usually be the format you want to use.  If you want to customize
the format, though, you can pass a string containing HTML that represents the
format.  Within this HTML the text %N represents the attribute name and %V its
value, so the default format is '&lt;b&gt;%N&lt;/b&gt;: %V'.
</p>

<p>
The predefined character sheet has five sections: 'Header', 'Attributes',
'FeatsAndSkills', 'Melee', and 'Magic'.  You can add attributes to any of these
five by giving its name as the second parameter. (You can also add a new
section by calling AddToSheet with a second parameter of '_top'.)  The third
parameter indicates where, within the section, the new attribute should be
displayed.  This will usually be the name of one of the attributes as displayed
on the character sheet.  Alternatively, you can place your new attribute at the
end of the section by giving <b>null</b> as the third parameter.
</p>

<a name="magicitems"><h3>Adding Magic Items</h3></a>
<p>
The Dungeon Master's guide contains a large selection of magic items, and most
DMs generate their own additional magic items from time to time.  Because of
this, Scribe presents only a minimal selection of magic items in its "Goodies"
menu, leaving it to the DM to customize the list to include the specific items
that appear in his or her campaign.  See the
<a href='#custom'>Customization</a> section for information on how to add
additional items to the Goodies list and the rules that specify the effects of
new items.
</p>

<a name="limitations"><h3>Limitations</h3></a>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>In general, Scribe only calculates and displays attributes that have
      effects during a campaign, not those that are important only between
      campaigns.  For example, characters get an ability increase every fourth
      level, but Scribe assumes that you handle this by increasing the desired
      ability number.</li>
  <li>Rule restrictions are not enforced.  For example, the fact that your
      character has only six skill points does not prevent you from
      distributing eight points (or eighty) among various skills.</li>
  <li>Half ranks for skills (a single point allocated to a cross-class skill)
      are not supported.</li>
  <li>The "Craft" and "Profession" skills are so general as to be useless.  DMs
      will likely want to use customization to add particular crafts (e.g.,
      carpentery) and professions (e.g., lawyer).
  <li>When an character ability score is modified, Scribe recalculates
      attributes based on that ability from scratch.  For example, bumping
      intelligence when a character reaches fourth level causes Scribe to
      recompute the number of skill points awarded at first level.  This
      might be considered a feature.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="todo"><h3>Bugs/To-do List</h3></a>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight load is not calculated.</li>
  <li>Armor-based spell failure percentages are not calculated.</li>
  <li>Spell schools are not indicated.  It would be particularly nice to flag
      spells within a Wizard's specialization.</li>
  <li>Weapon damage should be computed instead of fixed.</li>
</ul>
