<h2>Adding Homebrew Choices to Quilvyn's SRD v3.5 Rule Set</h2>

<p>
The SRD v3.5 rule set allows you to add homebrew choices to most of its
selections: companions, weapons, races, and so on. The entry dialog for each
type of choice includes fields for all the information particular to that
type. For most choices, the values to enter into the dialog can be determined
by comparing them to similar choices from the core rule books.
</p><p>
The input fields used to enter homebrew choices are similar to those used
by the Quilvyn editor&mdash;text fields, selection menus, checkboxes, etc.
One difference between the two is that you can enter multiple values into most
text boxes in the homebrew choices editor. For example, when entering a
homebrew deity, you will likely want to enter multiple values in the Domains
text box. To do this, separate the individual values by commas: Good,Law,War.
If you ever need to enter a single value that contains a comma into a text box,
enclose the value in quotes: "May create and mend magic weapons, armor, and
shields".
</p><p>
Although the widest text boxes that Quilvyn uses show around 40 characters, you
can enter longer text values. Only 40 characters will show at once, but you can
use your arrow keys to move the cursor within the full text. Several examples
below show only the beginning portion of longer values entered into text boxes.

<a name="animal-companion"><h2>Animal Companions and Familiars</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/hb-familiar.jpg' alt='Homebrew Familiar'/>
</td><td>
<p>
When adding an animal companion or familiar, Quilvyn displays fields for
entering the creature's basic attributes, hit dice, armor class, attack bonus,
damage, size, speed, and minimum master level. Quilvyn expects the damage value
to indicate the number and type of damage dice, optionally followed by a bonus
or penalty. For example, an Owlbear animal companion would have a damage
attribute of 1d6+5,1d6+5,1d8+2 (two claws and a bite), while a Donkey's damage
would be 1d2. When entering armor class, attack bonus, and damage, include
any bonus or penalty from attributes such as dexterity, natural armor, and
strength. Minimum master level is used for alternative animal companions that
require the character to be of higher level before they can be selected.
</p><p>
The example shown is taken from the statistics for the monkey from the Monster
Manual. Note that the monkey receives +2 size and +2 dexterity bonuses to armor
class, resulting in an overall AC of 14, and that the monkey's low strength
gives a -4 penalty to damage.

<a name="armor"><h2>Armors and Shields</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/hb-armor.jpg' alt='Homebrew Armor'/>
</td><td>
<p>
For homebrew armors and shields, Quilvyn displays fields for entering the boost
to armor class gained by using the armor or shield, the weight category, the
maximum dexterity armor class bonus allowed, the penalty applied to skills such
as Escape Artist, and the percentage chance of failure when casting arcane
spells.
</p><p>
The example shown gives the values for a breastplate made from mithral, as
discussed in the Special Materials section of the SRD. Making armor or a shield
from mithral reduces its weight by 1 category, spell failure chances by 10%,
and armor check penalty by 3, while increasing the maximum dexterity bonus by 2.

<a name="class"><h2>Base, Prestige, and NPC Classes</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/hb-npc.jpg' alt='Homebrew Class'/><br/>
</td><td>
<p>
When adding a homebrew base class, prestige class, or NPC class, Quilvyn
displays fields that allow you to specify optional class prerequisites, the
class hit dice, base attack and save progressions, skill points per level,
class skills and features, any automatic languages known by characters with the
class (e.g, druidic for druids), and information about class spellcasting.
</p><p>
The base attack entry gives a choice of 1/2 (increases by 1 every 2 levels, as
with the wizard class), 3/4 (increases by 3 every 4 levels, as with clerics),
or 1 (increases by 1 every level, as with fighters). Save entries give a choice
of 1/3 (sometimes referred to as "poor") or 1/2 ("good"). Features that are
acquired after level 1 (for example, the rogue Evasion feature acquired at
level 2) should be preceded by the level and a colon (so, 2:Evasion). For
classes that cast spells, the spell type, spell ability, and spell slots input
fields provide places to enter the type of spells (Arcane or Divine), the basic
ability used to calculate spell DCs, and the progression of spell slots
available to the caster. Each item in the spell slot text box gives a spell
type and level followed by a colon, then by a series of
&lt;count&gt;@&lt;level&gt; terms, each of which indicates how many spell slots
the class receives at the given level. For example, the spell slot entry for
the cleric class would include C2: 1@3; 2@4; 3@6; 4@9; 5@13, indicating that
clerics acquire 1 C2 slot at level 3, 2 at level 4, 3 at level 6, 4 at level 9,
and 5 at level 13.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a Shaman NPC class that has the same features
as the core rules' Adept NPC class. It has no prerequisites, d6 hit dice, and 2
skill points per level. Its base attack, fortitude save, and reflex save
progressions are poor and its will save progression good. Class skills are
Concentration, Craft, Handle Animal, Heal, Knowledge, Profession, Spellcraft,
and Survival. The only class features are Weapon Proficiency (Simple) and
Summon Familiar, with the latter acquired at level 2. The Shaman casts divine
spells with wisdom as the relevant ability. A Shaman receives 3 Adept0 spell
slots at level 1 (and no additional Adept0 slots thereafter), 1 Adept1 spell
slot at level 1, increasing to 2 at level 3 and 3 at level 7, and so on.

<p>
Quilvyn allows you to give classes and races new features and to replace
predefined features with homebrew ones. For homebrew features, Quilvyn displays
entries for the name of the class or race that gains the feature and the level
at which the feature is gained. If the feature is gained only if selected by
the user (e.g, a Cleric domain), enter the type in the Selectable Type box
("Domain"); otherwise, leave the box empty, indicating that all characters of
the given class or race gain the feature. Unlike most text boxes, the
Selectable Type field only accepts a single value. The Prerequisite box lists
any requirements that must be met to gain the feature, and Replace lists any
predefined features that this one replaces.
</p><p>
The first example shown adds another choice, Forge Domain, to the domains that
can be selected by clerics at level 1. It's a valid choice only for a cleric
whose deity has 'Forge' in their list of domains.
</p><p>
The second example replaces the predefined Dodge Giants feature for all dwarves
with a homebrew feature named Underground Warrior.

When adding a homebrew deity, Quilvyn displays fields to specify the deity's
alignment, favored weapon or weapons, and domains. As discussed above, multiple
domains entered in the Domains text box should be separated by commas.
Similarly, if the deity's favored weapon includes multiple weapons (e.g., all
flails), the individual weapons should be listed in the Favored Weapons text
box separated by commas.

<p>
For homebrew feats, Quilvyn displays fields to note the feat type and
any requirements that must be met to select it. The feat type will typically
be one of "General", "Item Creation", or "Metamagic"; you can also include
"Fighter" in the feat type box to indicate that this feat can be selected as a
fighter bonus feat. Quilvyn allows you to specify two kinds of requirements for
a feat. The Prerequisite box lists any requirements that must be met to select
the feat; Quilvyn generates a validation error if the feat is selected for a
character who does not meet these requirements. The Implies box lists any
requirements that, while not strictly required, make the feat useless if not
met. For example, although the rules don't require a caster level to select it,
the Combat Casting feat from the core rules is likely to be useful only to a
spell caster. Quilvyn will generate a validation warning if the Implies
requirements are not met. When specified, the Prerequisite and Implies fields
will normally contain references to character attributes; see the discussion of
<a href="#attrs">using character attributes</a> for how to include these. The
effects of a feat are entered separately as a feature.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a general feat named Flail Expert that can be
selected as a fighter bonus feat. The Prerequisite box notes that it requires a
baseAttack value of at least 1 and Weapon Proficiency (Martial), and the
Implies box notes that the feat is useless unless the character possesses a
flail. The example also shows the corresponding feature that describes the
effect of selecting the Flail Expert feat.

character sheet (one of attributes, combat, companion, feature, magic, save, or
skill) where the note for the feature should appear, then enter the note text.
You can enter multiple sections and notes, but the number of sections entered
must equal the number of notes. Feature notes can both reference and modify
character attributes; see the discussion of
<a href="#attrs">using character attributes</a> for how to do this.

<p>
When adding a homebrew race, Quilvyn displays fields that allow you to enter
prerequisites, features, and languages for the race. Although none of the core
races have requirements, Quilvyn provides the Prerequisite entry to allow you
to specify a race that has, for example, a minimum strength requirement. Most
races will have fixed features, such as an ability adjustment. Quilvyn also
allows entering selectable features to support variations such as sub-races.
Each feature in these lists will require <a href="#feature">adding a feature</a>
to describe its effects. The Languages field lists the languages that
characters of this race know automatically.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for the Lizardfolk character race from the Monster
Manual. Features for this race are: Lizardfolk Ability Adjustment; Lizardfolk
Skills; Bonus Feat; Scaly Hide; Lizardfolk Weapons; and Hold Breath. (Most of
these feature names are created for this example; the MM simply lists the
effects.) The corresponding feature entries for the first two of these are

<a name="attrs"><h2>Using Character Attributes in Prerequisites and Notes</h2></a>
<p>
There are three places that you might want to use references to character
attributes when adding homebrew choices: prerequisites for homebrew classes,
feats, class and race features, and races; in feature notes that modify
character attributes; and embedded in feature notes and spell descriptions.
Attribute references appear somewhat differently in each of these contexts.
</p><p>
The examples below develop a homebrew feat named Alert Dodger. Like the monk AC
Bonus feature, this feat allows a character to add their (positive) wisdom
modifier to their armor class. This will be a general feat that can be taken
as a fighter bonus feat, so the initial entry for the feat looks like this:
</p>
<img src='../Images/hb-attr-0.jpg' alt='Alert Dodger feat'/>

<h2>Using attributes in prerequisites</h2>

<p>
In the core rulebook, many feats and all prestige classes have
prerequisites&mdash;attribute values that the character must have to take the
feat or a level in the prestige class. Quilvyn allows you to specify similar
prerequisites when entering a homebrew class, feat, or race.
</p><p>
Since the effects of the Alert Dodger feat come from battle experience, it
makes sense to require a minimum base attack bonus&mdash;say, 3&mdash;to take
the feat. This is represented by adding text to the feat's Prerequisite field:
</p>
<img src='../Images/hb-attr-1.jpg' alt='Alert Dodger feat'/>

<p>
Quilvyn will generate tests for this requirement and will show a validation
error if a character with a base attack bonus of 2 or less is given this feat.
You can also specify that the character must have a specific feature as part of
your prerequisites. For the Alert Dodger feat, it seems reasonable to require
that the character also have the Dodge feature:
</p>
<img src='../Images/hb-attr-2.jpg' alt='Alert Dodger feat'/>

<p>
Finally, although a high wisdom might not be required to take this feat, it
will make little sense to do so unless the character's wisdom is at least 12,
giving a positive wisdom modifier. This can be specified by adding text to
the Implies field:
</p>
<img src='../Images/hb-attr-3.jpg' alt='Alert Dodger feat'/>

<p>
Within prerequisites, Quilvyn recognizes the common comparison operators
(&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, !=), and you can use the OR operator (||) to
require that at least one of a set of prerequisites is satisfied:
</p><p>
<code>intelligence &gt;= 15 || wisdom &gt;= 15</code>
</p><p>
When making a comparison to a text value rather than a number, surround the
value with single or double quotes. Quilvyn also supports the matching
operators =~ (matches) and !~ (does not match) with strings. The first of these
two prerequisites requires that the character have a Lawful Good alignment,
while the second allows any good alignment:
</p><p>
<code>alignment == 'Lawful Good'</code><br/>
<code>alignment =~ 'Good'</code>
</p><p>
(You can think of the =~ and !~ operators as "contains" and "does not contain",
but they actually perform a pattern match, treating their second operand as a
regular expression. This means that certain characters, such as * and ?, have
special meanings if they appear in the second operand. The Mozilla project
provides a web page with
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions">a detailed description of regular expressions</a>.)
</p>

<h2>Using features to modify character attributes</h2>

<p>
With the Alert Dodger feat definition complete, the next step is to create the
corresponding feature, also named Alert Dodger. This will add the description
of the feat to the character sheet and allow Quilvyn to create rules to
implement its effects. Since the feat affects a character's armor class, its
note will fit best in the combat section of the character sheet.
</p><p>
To illustrate how Quilvyn processes feature notes, we'll initially define the
Alert Dodger feat to add a fixed +2 to the character's armor class, switching
later to adding the wisdom modifier instead.
</p>

<img src='../Images/hb-attr-feature-0.jpg' alt='Alert Dodger feature'/>

<p>
Given this definition, Quilvyn will automatically generate a rule that adds two
to the character's armor class value, and the note will appear in italics on
the character sheet. For readability, character attributes in feature notes
must appear as shown above, with initial capital letters and spaces between
words.
</p><p>
Single features can modify multiple attributes; in these cases, the note should
list the individual modifications separated by slashes. This was shown above in
the <a href="#race">race definition example</a>, where the note for the
Lizardfolk Ability Adjustment read:
</p>

<code>+2 Strength/+2 Constitution/-2 Intelligence</code>

<p>
Notes in the save and skill sections can modify save bonuses and skill
modifiers by referencing the save type or skill name directly; the saves. and
skillModifiers. prefixes are not necessary:
</p>

<code>+1 Fortitude</code><br/>
<code>+2 Ride/+2 Handle Animal</code>

<h2>Embedding attributes in features notes and spell descriptions</h2>

<p>
Some feats, many class features, and nearly all spells have effects that vary
based on character attributes. For example: the Spell Mastery feat allows a
wizard to prepare a number of spells equal to their intelligence modifier
without referring to their spellbook; an assassin's Death Attack can inflict
paralysis for 1d6 rounds + 1 round per assassin level; and the
<i>Acid Splash</i> spell has a range of 25' + 5' per 2 caster levels.
</p><p>
You can embed references to character attributes in the text of feature notes
and spell descriptions by enclosing them within the characters %{}. Using this
ability, the note for the Spell Mastery feat looks like this:
</p>

<code>May prepare %{intelligenceModifier} spells w/out spellbook</code>

<p>
When Quilvyn displays this note on the character sheet, it first replaces the
reference to the character's intelligenceModifier attribute with its value, so
the note might appear on the sheet as
</p><p>
<code>May prepare 2 spells w/out spellbook</code>
</p><p>
We can use this ability to replace the fixed +2 entered earlier for the effects
of the Alert Dodger feature with an amount equal to the character's wisdom
modifier, giving us its final definition:
</p>

<img src='../Images/hb-attr-feature-1.jpg' alt='Alert Dodger feature'/>

<p>
Given this note, Quilvyn will automatically generate a rule to add the
character's wisdom modifier to their armor class and will display the note in
italics.
</p><p>
Beyond simple references, Quilvyn supports performing calculations within
embedded references. The note for the assassin's Death Attack feature looks
like this:
</p><p>
<code>Sneak attack after 3 rd of study causes death or paralysis for 1d6+%{levels.Assassin} rd (DC %{10 + levels.Assassin + intelligenceModifier} Fort neg)</code>
</p><p>
As this note shows, individual notes and descriptions can contain multiple
embedded references, and individual references can use multiple attributes.
</p><p>
Within embedded references, Quilvyn supports the common comparison operators
(&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, !=), the common arithmetic operators
(+, -, *, /, unary -), AND (&amp;&amp;), OR (||), matching (=~, !~),
and integer division (//). It also supports the ternary if-then-else operator
(?:) and the operators &lt;? and &gt;?, which return the smaller and larger
of their two operands, respectively. Using these operators, we can define the
note for the barbarian Rage feature as follows, which takes into account the
fact that the larger constitution bonuses of the Greater Rage and Mighty Rage
features extend the duration of the rage:
</p>

<code>+4 Str, +4 Con, +2 Will, -2 AC for %{constitutionModifier + 5 + (features.Greater Rage ? 1 : 0) + (features.Mighty Rage ? 1 : 0)} rd %{1 + levels.Barbarian // 4}/dy</code>

<p>
Within spell descriptions, in addition to <a href="#attrs">common character
attributes</a>, Quilvyn makes available the special character attribute lvl.
This variable refers to the caster level appropriate to the specific spell:
casterLevels.Cleric for the C1 spell <i>Bane</i>, casterLevels.Bard for the B0
spell <i>Dancing Lights</i>, casterLevels.Sorcerer for the S2 spell <i>Arcane
Lock</i>, and so on. Using the lvl attribute allows you to incorporate the
caster level into a spell description that works for multiple classes. The
description of the <i>Enhance Skill</i> spell example from
<a href="#spell">adding a spell</a> reads:
</p>

<code>R%{25+lvl//2*5}' Target gains +4 on chosen skill for %{lvl} rd</code>

<p>
When showing this description on the character sheet, Quilvyn will replace the
references to lvl with the character's cleric, sorcerer, or wizard level, as
appropriate. For example, the description for the S3 <i>Enhance Skill</i>
spell for a level 7 sorcerer will read:
</p>

<code>R40' Target gains +4 on chosen skill for 7 rd</code>
