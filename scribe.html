 * If this file defines a CustomizeScribe function, Scribe calls it after

 * CustomizeScribe, you can place URLs for scripts you want to load from
 * external files into CUSTOMIZATION_URLS, and the default implementation of
 * CustomizeScribe below will load them.  A set of sample customization
 * scripts, listed below, comes packaged with the Scribe software; remove the
 * comment markers from around any of these that you would like Scribe to use.
 * If any of the elements of CUSTOMIZATION_URLS begins with a question mark
 * (e.g., '?DMG35.js'), Scribe will prompt the user on start-up to ask whether
 * to include the rules from that script.  This can be useful for rules that
 * you use occasionally but don't want always present.  For example, you might
 * want to put a question mark before DMG35.js to occasionally use the rules
 * to define NPC- or prestige-class NPCs.
