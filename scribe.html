These definitions determine where your browser looks for the Scribe source
files; the values below direct it to retrieve local copies.  If you change the
second line to read "var SOURCE_URL = SCRIBE_HOME;", then all other Scribe
source files will be downloaded from the Scribe web site each time the program
runs.  If you make this change you automatically get software updates every
time you run the program; however, the disadvantage is that you have to wait
for the code to download each time.

If this file defines a CustomizeScribe function, Scribe calls it after loading,
allowing you to add custom behavior to the program.  Each of CustomizeScribe's
parameters is a function that you can use to perform one type of customization.
These functions allow you to:

Add new choices to one of the editor's selection lists.  The editor defines the
lists 'alignments', 'classes', 'domains' (cleric spell domains), 'feats',
'genders', 'helms', 'languages', 'races', 'schools' (wizard spell schools),
'shields', 'skills', 'spells', and 'weapons'.  For example, this line would add
'Aquan' to the list of languages that characters can learn:

 AddChoices('languages', 'Aquan');

Add rules to compute new character attributes or modify existing ones. Each
call to AddRules requires the name of the attribute to modify, followed by one
or more sets of values that specify the name of the attribute that affect the
one modified, the type of effect it has, and an expression used to calculate
the effect.  For example, this set of rules would compute an attribute called
languageCount based on race and intelligence:

 AddRules('languageCount',
   'race', '=', 'source == "Elf" ? 3 : source == "Half Elf" ? 2 : 1',
   'intelligence', '+', 'source > 14 ? source - 14 : 0');

Add information to the character sheet.  For each attribute to be added, list
its name, the section where it should appear, the attribute it should be appear
before, and the format for the display.  This line would insert the
languageCount attribute computed above into the character sheet before the
language list.

 AddToSheet('languageCount', 'FeatsAndSkills', 'Languages', null);

Instead of placing all your customization code here, you can modularize your
customizastions by using additional script tags to load functions from other
JavaScript files, then have CustomizeScribe invoke each function in turn.
