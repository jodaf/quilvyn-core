<!--
These definitions determine where your browser looks for the Scribe source
files; the values below direct it to retrieve local copies.  If you change the
second line to read "var SOURCE_URL = SCRIBE_HOME;", then all other Scribe
source files will be downloaded from the Scribe web site each time the program
runs.  If you make this change you automatically get software updates every
time you run the program; however, the disadvantage is that you have to wait
for the code to download each time.
-->
<script>
var SCRIBE_HOME = 'http://www.jodaf.com/dnd/scribe/';
var SOURCE_URL = '';

<!--
A few user preferences you may want to change: the background color for
Scribe's windows, the number of recent opens shown in the file menu, and the
prefix and suffix used to expand abbreviated character file urls.

<!--
These definitions determine whether Scribe uses rules from v3.0 or v3.5 of the
Players' Manual. CLASS_RULES_VERSION determines the version of the class and
race rules, FEAT_RULES_VERSION the version of the feat and skill rules, along
with the list of feats and skills, and MAGIC_RULES_VERSION the version of magic
rules, along with the list of spells.  Each value can be '3.0' or '3.5',
indicating a single version, or '3.0/3.5' or '3.5/3.0', indicating that both
sets of rules should be used.  In the latter case, the second version listed
takes precedence for rules that are incompatible between the versions.
-->
<script>
var CLASS_RULES_VERSION = '3.5';
var FEAT_RULES_VERSION = '3.5';
var MAGIC_RULES_VERSION = '3.5';

If this file defines a CustomizeScribe function, Scribe calls it after loading,
allowing you to add custom behavior to the program.  See help.html for details.
Instead of placing all your customization code in this file, you can modularize
your customizations by using additional script tags to load functions from
other JavaScript files, then have CustomizeScribe invoke each function in turn.
An example of this is shown below.

<script src="CustomizeDeities.js"></script>
<script src="CustomizeGoodies.js"></script>
<script src="CustomizeSkills.js"></script>
<script src="CustomizeSpellPoints.js"></script>

  if(window.CustomizeDeities == null)
    alert('Unabled to load CustomizeDeities.js');
