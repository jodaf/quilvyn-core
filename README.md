## Scribe RPG character sheet generator

Scribe generates character sheets for paper-and-pencil roll playing game
(RPG) characters.  Using basic values (abilities, class, name, etc.) entered
in a form window, the program applies the rules contained in the RPG source
books and displays formatted information about the character in a separate
window.  Character information can be saved for later retrieval and editing.

The scribe-core package bundles core modules required for basic program
functionality and modules that support the v3.5 System Reference Document.
Additional plugins, available separately, extend the program to cover other
RPG games and campaign settings.
