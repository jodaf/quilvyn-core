## Quilvyn Tabletop Role-Playing Game Character Sheet Generator

Quilvyn generates character sheets for paper-and-pencil role playing game
(RPG) characters.  Using basic values (abilities, class, name, etc.) entered
in a form window, the program applies the rules contained in the RPG source
books and displays formatted information about the character in a separate
window.  Character information can be saved for later retrieval and editing.

The quilvyn-core package bundles core modules required for basic program
functionality and modules that support the <a href="http://dndsrd.net/">v3.5
System Reference Document</a>. Additional plugins, available separately, extend
the program to cover other RPG games and campaign settings.
